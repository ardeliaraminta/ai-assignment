 do you have weitek s address phone number i d like to get some information about this chip ,1
 i certainly do use it whenever i have to do tiff and it usually works very well that s not my point i m philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity this complexity has led to some programs poor tiff writers making some very bizarre files other programs inability to load tiff images though they ll save them of course and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand tiff as the saying goes it s not me i m worried about it s all the abuse of tiff over the years and i chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format in the words of the tiff spec appendix g page g capitalized emphasis mine the only problem with this sort of success is that tiff was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity it takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification probably no application does a complete job and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any tiff image since there are so many image generating applications out there now if a program or worse all applications can t read every tiff image that means there are some it won t some that i might have to deal with why would i want my images to be trapped in that format i don t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does of course ,1

 the otis project the operative term is stimulate this file last updated what is otis otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution digital immortality the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future perhaps they ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up if that doesn t interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it s stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts keep your own copies of the images to look at when you ve got the gumption that s what they re here for where otis currently as of has two ftp sites projects otis the uwi site sunsite unc edu pub multimedia pictures otis the sunsite you can also gopher to this site for otis as well merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory don t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you re in binary otis has also been spreading to some dial up bbs systems around north america the following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha lines cyberden sanfran usenet waffle iron how do you contribute what happens is you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftp put it in the contrib incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory computer originated works are also welcome otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to see these viewers are available for all types of computers at most large ftp sites around internet jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find if you can t find one but do have a gif viewer you can obtain a jpg to gif conversion program which will change jpg files to a standard gif format otis also accepts animation files when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view also include some biographical information on yourself we ll be having info files on each contributing artist and their works you can also just upload a text file of info about yourself instead of emailing if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope merely send copies to the otis project c o ed stastny po bx omaha ne i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them include an ample sase if you want your stuff back also include information on each image preferably a line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it s finally put if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we ll arrange things if you want to submit your works by disk peachy merely send a disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg if you can t we can convert from most formats we d just rather not have to at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand even if you don t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or for disk postage and packing to get a slab o otis as of we re at about megabytes of files and growing email me for current archive size and directory distribution the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images it would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is it s the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs system or even just post this info file there it would be keen of you use if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the artists directory under the artists name if permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it if no info is available email me ed cwis unomaha edu and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture this gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you you may also want to include a title address or other information you d like people to know hmmm that s about it for now more guidelines will be added as needed your input is expected disclaimer the otis project has no connection to the church of otis a sumerian deity or it s followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator we do take sacrifices and donations however disclaimer the otis project is here for the distribution of original image files the files will go to the public at large it s possible as with any form of mass media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain unless you ve given permission for that it s illegal otis takes no responsibility for this in simple terms all rights revert to the author artist to leave an image on otis is to give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed electronically if you don t want your images distributed all over don t upload them to leave an image on otis is not giving permission to have it used in any publication or broadcast that incurs profit this includes but is not limited to magazines newsletters clip art software screen printed clothing etc you must give specific permission for this sort of usage remember the operative term is stimulate if you know of people

our group recently bought a mitsubishi p u video printer and i could use some help with it we bought this thing because it has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and claimed to print gray level images however the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print and bit pixel images after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlett packard workstation and i can print and bit pixel images just fine i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs this was not mentioned in the sales literature however they did say the p u can do bit pixel level images in parallel mode but they didn t have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do bit pixel images from the video source it can t store bits pixel in the memory it s not like memory is that expensive any more if anybody has any information on getting bit pixel or even bit pixel images out of this thing i would greatly appreciate your sending it to me thanks ,1

 well it s been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of reprinting without permission so sue me eric haines reprint of the very interesting discussion of this topic jonas o o x snip snip x o o give a man a fish and he ll eat one day give a man a fishing rod and he ll laze around fishing and never do anything with that in mind i reprint without permission so sue me relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem note the early use of postscript technology predating many of this year s papers listed in the april st siggraph program announcement posted here a few days ago eric intersection between a line and a polygon undecidable by dave baraff tom duff from deb charisma graphics cornell edu newsgroups comp graphics keywords p np jordan curve separation ursyhon metrization theorem organization program of computer graphics i think that this is a very difficult problem to start with lines and polygons are semi algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points here are a few off the cuff ideas first we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated now the jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open and thus non compact regions thus the line lies completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so this is a decision problem one possibility the decision model approach is to reduce the question to some other well known problem q and then try to solve q an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript see postscript language by adobe systems incorporated isbn co so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer by output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus the original problem there are two small problems with this approach there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the reduced problem q so we will be forced to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently zorn s lemma but the use of the axiom of choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days more importantly the question arises as to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other words will it halt now postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is undecidable it is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable i won t even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite precision and running out of ink paper or both a couple of references might be principia mathematica newton i cambridge university press cambridge england sorry i don t have an isbn for this an introduction to automata theory languages and computation hopcroft j and ulman j the c programming language kernighan b and ritchie d a tale of two cities dickens c from td alice uucp tom duff summary overkill organization at t bell laboratories murray hill nj the situation is not nearly as bleak as baraff suggests he should know better he s hung around the labs for long enough by the well known dobbin dullman reduction see j dullman d dobbin j comp obfusc ii pp lemma a line polygon intersection can be reduced to hamiltonian circuit without the use of grobner bases so lpi to coin an acronym is probably only np complete besides turing completeness will no longer be a problem once our cray is delivered since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in milliseconds with scatter gather from deb svax cs cornell edu david baraff well sure its no worse than np complete but that s only if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a lipschitz condition on its second derivative i think there s an siggraph paper from caltech that deals with this ,1

yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal version did it quite well apart from a few hassles with radial fills version revb is better but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like cannot export scodal with bitmap at least it does on my version if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears temporal images make a product called filmpak which converts autocad plots to scodal postscript to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs and i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper ,1

 i used this combination for a while a qcr z recorder i think and as far as i remember corel can export in scodal scd format just select export on the main file menu this may not be implemented in earlier versions of course in which case you re on your own also i seem to think that the s w for the qcr z at the time did strange and very undesirable things if any part of the pic was outside the screen area on corel i once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that one pixel had somehow strayed off screen causing my whole slide to be blank the qcr z also couldn t handle grad fill over grad fill so if you use a graduated colour background if you then grad fill an object on top of this the fill appears on the final slide as a circle i think and totally ignores the shape of the object being filled of course if the recorder isn t a qcr you can ignore all this and feel suitably ,1

in regards to fractal commpression i have seen fractal compressed movies they were both fairly impressive the first one was a gray scale movie of casablanca it was mb and had minutes of fps video it was a little grainy but not bad at all the second one i saw was only minutes but it had bit color with fps and measured in at mb i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore but unlike many other formats out there you do end up losing resolution i don t know what kind of software hardware was used for creating the movies i saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took minutes per frame to generate but as i said above playback was or more frames per second and how else could you put minutes on one floppy disk ,1
 i use xwd xpr from the x r dist and various programs of the ppm tools to print hardcopies of colored x windows my problem is i don t like xpr it gives at least the x r version does louzy output the hardcopy looks very grainy to me instead i use pnmtops this takes full advantage postscript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel image to black and white dots so if you have a postscript printer try xwdtopnm xwdfile convert to ppm ppmtopgm to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops noturn to postscript lpr print pnmtops has several neat options but use them with care if you want your image to be wide use pnmtops noturn scale width noturn prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it is high width specifies the paper width not the image width see below scale is used because if the image is small it may fit within a width less than and will thus be printed smaller than wide if you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width in short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size but it will not blow it up automatically hope this helps marcel ,1
 the gl p lzh stuff under gfx show on the aminet sites includes a utility called pic hl that is a filter for hamlab that can handle the most commonly used kinds of pic and clp files the biggest problem is that the clp files don t usually contain a palette so you need to convert a pic with the right palette first which creates a ram picpal file and then convert the clp files ,1

 ch concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in ch favor of doing this i learn an awful lot about all aspects of ch graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to ch algorithms i just think making different groups out of this ch is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group ch i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for ch discussing all aspects of graphics anyone else feel this way ch just curious i must agree there is a dizzying number of c s amiga newsgroups already in addition there are very few issues which fall cleanly into one of these categories also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga groups is already plagued with mega crossposting thus the group split would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured environment ,1

there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters the points x y z on a spherical surface with radius r and center a b c can be written as x a y b z c r this equation can be rewritten into the following form ax by cz r a b c x y z approximate the left hand part by f x y z p x p x p z p for all datapoints i c determine the parameters p p which minimise the average error f x y z x y z in numerical recipes in c can be found algorithms to solve these parameters the best fitting sphere will have center a b c p p p radius r sqrt p a a b b c c so at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations i think ,1

you ll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g b values in the range from for most cards for a particular palette colour in the range from for colour modes then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than unique rgb triplets for a colour mode ,1
 i m sure it is and i am not amused every time i read that part of the tiff spec it infuriates me and i m none too happy about the complexity of the spec anyway because i think their arbitrary but carefully chosen number is neither additionally i find their choice of bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why not just use the letters tiff and no i don t think they should have bothered to support both word orders either and i ve found that many tiff readers actually don t ,1

i am working on a program to display d wireframe models with the user being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters also the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so that they can move around while the user is exploring the wireframe world to do this i am thinking of using the srgp package described in the van dam foley and feiner book but i was wondering if there was another pd graphics package out there which was faster i would like to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides satisfactory real time performance on a sun ipx ideally i m looking for a pd graphics package which will allow me to open a new window under x and allow me to draw lines within the window also it would also need to have some sort of event driven interaction handling since the user is going to move around the wireframe models using the keyboard if you know or wrote such a package i would be grateful if you could direct me to a ftp site which contains the package thank you ,1

 i ve got the spec obviously since i quoted it in my last posting my gripe about tiff is that it s far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read which i think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images e g paint programs in a nutshell i don t think tiff is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly and then it wouldn t be tiff anymore they keep trying to cut it back but it s late now maybe they will fix it and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility that would probably make me happy ,1

 opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r based bit multiprocessor systems if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t give up we know it josh ,1

a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he isn t in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out so here it comes cview has quite a number of bugs the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous as far as i can determine it has to do with the temp files that cview creates cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory the problem you mention occurs as far as i can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview doesn t check properly for this situation as cview decodes a jpeg it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with bit colour information then for bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the bit colour information while it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of bit data it recopies all the data from the bit file to your screen again it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled the result of this process is the following if it runs out of disk space when writing the first bit file all you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes reads aren t performed if it has enough room for the bit data but runs out of room for the bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card however then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk this is just a guess but probably fairly accurate at least the general idea is on track i think although i have probably made errors in details about file i o etc the way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space the temp files for large jpeg s x and bigger can be very large meg meg on some of the largest i have needed in excess of meg free disk space cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory and fat table i can t remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way so be careful it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi lighter square incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing ,1
printer model and specification canon clc color laser copier ps ipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit hello we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier printer we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network the copier printer has both a parallel and scsi interface i have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer i can also print rgb files but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter the canon clc is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable we create the postscript files with a variaty of programs such as showcase xv and tops when we convert to postscript with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of rather than the default the output is better but still much less that acceptable note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality pictures we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the scsi port to my knowledge this software is and does not come with a warranty the management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work here my questions if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or parallel port what is the quality of the printouts is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts what is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer the big question where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer please email directly to me i don t not read news on a regular basis i will post a summary thanks in advance ,1

 yeah corel draw and wordperfect presentations pretty limited here too since there s no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program this tracing technique is about it simple stuff like b w logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes haywire i suspect even though i don t write code that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares we re using but even so how come one hasn t been written to my knowledge i mean even hijaak one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion hasn t attempted it yet ,1

 by grey level images you mean items of bit images it does work but it doesn t work if you have more than bit in your screen and if the screen intensity is non linear with bit per pixel there could be c c timing this gives levels but they are linear if screen intensity is linear with c c it works but we have to find the best compinations there s levels but choises best must be chosen different compinations for the same level varies a bit but the levels keeps their order readers should verify what i wrote ,1
 rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which programming interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book i wrote an article for the x resource which discusses the differences between phigs and pexlib it will appear in issue which should be out pretty soon but here s a brief summary phigs is a graphics api which was designed to be portable to many devices most implementations support the x window system and take advantage of a d extension to x called pex pexlib is a slightly lower level api which was designed to efficiently support the pex extension to x some advantages of using pexlib integrates with xlib xt motif etc better than phigs provides immediate mode capabilities is free of policy pex supports phigs but is currently being extended to support features not found in phigs like texture mapping anti aliasing pexlib will give you access to all of these features some advantages of using phigs support for multiple devices not just x based ones support for archiving metafiles hardcopy output phigs has predefined input devices to make input easier phigs can handle exposure events and resizing for you phigs can help you with colormap selection creation if you re working strictly in x and don t care about things like archiving i would go with pexlib either way you will find that both api s have a lot in common ,1
 yes i do a couple of years ago i did a comparison of the two products some of this may have changed but here goes as far as a phigs implementation figaro is fine but its phigs personally i hate phigs because i find it is too low level i also dislike structure editing which i find impossible but enough about phigs i have found hoops to be a system that is full featured and easy to use they support all of their rendering methods in software when there is no hardware support their documentation is good and they are easily portable to other systems i would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific questions ,1

i m working upon a game using an isometric perspective similar to that used in populous basically you look into a room that looks similar to the following xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hard coded for a particular vantage in my case wall two s rising edge has a slope of i m also using mode x x i ve run into two problems i m sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions the routines for drawing walls were trivial but when i ran a packed planar image through them i was dismayed by the jaggies i m now considered some anti aliasing routines speed is not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden wall presents a problem the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape currently i take and produce line follows the slope line is directly under line line moves up a line and left pixels line is under line this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels but it causes distortions has anyone come up with a better way perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z buffering locations are stored in x y z form for those of you who noticed the top lines of wall and wall are parallel with its bottom lines this is why there appears to be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood there are no vanishing points this simplifies the drawing code for objects which don t have to change size as they move about in the room i ve decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity thanks in advance for any help ,1

processing laboratory s image processing system michael landy co wrote and sell a general purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages sun gfx sun console matrox vip iti ip lexidata macintosh ii x windowing system and iris the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max video hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because of hips is machine independent availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production oriented tasks it is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel to

getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks the standard vga and ega outputs are very different than the ntsc format used by televisions while there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit if you have access to an amiga computer that has an ntsc output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output unfortunately this would be frame by frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program ,1

 it s really not that hard to do there are books out there which explain everything and the basic d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source also quickdraw has a lot of d functions built in and think pascal can access them and i would expect that think c could as well if you can find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast libertarian atheist semi anarchal techno rat ,1

i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices the postscript literature explains the process to some extent they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in postscript environments where it is absent the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate new coord round old coord doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in from reading i thought that what they might actually do is new coord trunc old coord this results in all the coordinates ending in either or whichever is closer by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript i find that neither of these is what dps really uses since i like how the dps result looks better than how my stuff looks i d like to know if anyone who knows how dps does it is willing able to tell me thanks ,1

sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month i m the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames per second it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are off the shelf software packages available to get you going much faster being targeted directly at the vr application developer some of the most popular are in no particular order division inc redwood city ca dvs sens inc sausalito ca worldtoolkit naval postgraduate school monterey ca npsnet free gemini technology corp irvine ca gvs simation series paradigm simulation inc dallas tx visionworks audioworks silicon graphics inc mountain view ca iris performer there are some others but not off the top of my head there are too many to list here but here is a smattering fake space labs menlo park ca boom virtual technologies inc stanford ca cyberglove digital image design new york ny the cricket d input kaiser electro optics carlsbad ca sim eye helmet displays virtual research sunnyvale ca flight helmet display virtual reality inc pleasantville ny head mtd displays s w software systems san jose ca d modeling software etc etc etc read some of the vr books on the market virtual reality ken pimental and ken texiera sp virtual mirage artificial reality myron kreuger etc or check out the newsgroup sci virtual worlds feel free to contact me for more info regards josh ,1

 yeah and it s also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in general i don t argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals i just question whether you should the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can t model should be replaced with a random number generator that has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but i don t think it has much to do with fractals and i certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner i guess i just haven t seen all these earth shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists i really hope i do but i m not holding my self similar breath uh huh i ll believe it when i see it i ve been chasing fractal compression for a few years and i still don t believe in it if it s so great how come we don t see it competing with jpeg cause it can t i ll wager actually i have wagered i quit trying to make fractal compression work and i was trying because i don t think it s a reasonable alternative to other techniques it is neat though i ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal that s why i don t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but i don t see anyone using it in a real product it s been six years since iterated systems was formed right there are always going to be questions until there s a product out there sloan replies the company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer he says in march iterated systems will have the other half of the system the decoders scientific american march page ,1

hi steve as the author of multiverse i feel i had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes but a few have had a few problems with their platforms not all unix s are the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible the main problem is that i don t have access to other platforms than the rs so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would bother releasing it if that was the case perhaps you didn t read the few docs that are supplied the dogfight world is made up of clients only so if you re in there on your own then you re not going to see anything the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary so if you don t see anything there then this is definitely a problem one final word if you re not interested don t bother with it if you are interested then please remember that i m not asking for any money so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism maybe that will get results ,1

 i think one not ideal solution is to use the tracing utility can t remember the name sorry included in the corel draw s w pack it can convert bitmaps to corel art format these can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap result the file is completely in corel format and can be scodal ed no problem but the slight problem with this which makes the solution less than idea is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments so the scodal taking much longer to image the obvious solution is time consuming stripping out the extra points by hand using corel ouch i ve done it a few times as i say if you don t mind the problems go via the route bitmap corel via trace hand trimming using corel combine with main corel pic via import scodal,1

 good i had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface of similarly colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of these algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly when determining which plane the points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite r when intersecting the two lines there are possibilities they are the same line the points were on a planar circle they are different lines but parallel there is a sphere of in radius this last case can be achieved with colinier points and any th point by taking the th point and pairs of the first parallel lines will be produced it can also be achieved by if all points are coplanar but are not on one circle it seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the points are coplanar the algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar points being colinear coplanar testing if the th point is coplanar when the plane of the first points has been found is trivial ,1

what are the main advantages of this method i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a little bit long i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counter clockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a d polygon has anyone heard of this method before it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it libertarian atheist semi anarchal techno rat ,1

 snip the do is not a snip the do box is based on an arm risc processor one or two custom graphics chips a dsp a double speed cdrom and mb of ram vram i m a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and ram vram capacity it was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the electronic cafe in santa monica ca from do rj mical of amiga lynx fame and hal josephson sp were there to talk about the machine and their plan we got to see the unit displaying full screen movies using the compactvideo codec which was nice very little blockiness showing clips from jaws and backdraft and a very high frame rate to boot like fps note however that the do s screen resolution is x compactvideo is pretty amazing i also wanted to point out that quicktime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above i m sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine i have a q and do this quite a bit the price of generality personally i don t use the dynamic sizing of movies often if ever but playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest machines i m not sure how a centris mhz stacks up against the mhz arm in the do box obviously the arm is faster but how much ,1
hi everyone because no one has touched the problem i posted last week i guess my question was not so clear now i d like to describe it in detail the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse in other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball s center is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer is no ironically dmis an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong the software was also sold internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified parts with ellipse were will be discarded and most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse are will be used i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical i am now wondering if i didn t touch the base and make things complicated please give me a hint i know you may argue this is not a cg problem you are right it is not however so many people involved in the problem sphere from poits why not an ellipse and why not its offset please post here and let the others share our interests i got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers ,1

i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a d scanline renderer i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face is how to use the even odd or non winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font the inside outline which is counterclockwise one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges i do not want to use this simplistic system since it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts it does not properly handle the even odd or non winding rules from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the d scanline renderer my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and or offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i can t tell which method is the best to implement thanks for any pointers rob lansdale ,1

 basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines if the result is pi then it is inside if pi then it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside my experience tells the second method is relible hope this helps ,1

 description of experiment deleted more deleted a few years ago a friend and i took some grey level photos from a bit mac plus screen using this method displaying all levels synchronized to the hz display took about seconds after experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable contrast the quality of the images was pretty good there were no visible contrast bands to minimize the exposure time the display program built different bit frames the first contained a dot only for pixels that had value the second only for pixels that had value etc these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to or onto the screen in sequence creating these frames sometimes took minutes on that old mac but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway and yes we wrote directly to the screen memory mea culpa our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center it took an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print who d have guessed ,1
 i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel i would suggest that you take your code and submit it to comp sys mac binaries to be distributed including to the ftp sites many folks myself included would enjoy the extra code just to clarify the d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys d library and it actually did a lot however it is quite limited in the sense that it s a low level d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects other things to consider when talking about apple s old d grafsys library unsupported never was and no plans exist to do so in the future undocumented unless you call header files documentation if one knows something about graphics you could probably figure it out but i d assume there s better software available that gives better output and is at the same time programmatically nicer i e easier to program just my tax,1

host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for

readme file in the distribution for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings

 i spoke with the author of macwireframe earlier today the cost is but there are no license royalties his name is eric johnson in sacramento ca phone he doesn t have email very nice guy very knowledgeable about graphics seems like he may have a decent package it s an object pascal framework that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes i m going to check it out and see if it s got what i need for my cad package i also found another package d graphic tools by micro system options in seattle the number is also no email the package is strong at ray tracing i m not too sure about its geometry creation tools i also need to look into this package some more i also spoke with the author mark owens another nice guy that seems to know his business the price is no royalties ,1

 dmorf dave s morph i think is what it means and dtax dave s tga assembler are available in the msdos uploads directory on the wuarchive they are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions dmorfx exe and dtax exe you can also find a version of aaplay exe there with which you can view files you create with dta exe or dtax exe i downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing away the afternoons since the programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not ready to spread to the masses but they are very well written the interface is frustrating at first but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks i have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option not sure why since i don t have the source i think it was written for tp if anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing to work right tell me it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if i just used the durned splines then it would work ,1

concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of doing this i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to algorithms i just think making different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics anyone else feel this way just curious i disagree you could learn the same amount by reading all the split groups and it would make things easier for those of us who are less omnivorous there is no waste in creating news groups its just a bit of shuffling about i have no problem with only a few posts per week per group i spend too much time on this as it is ,1

 it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints and energy calculations which are relevant the above method is described in more or less detail in inproceedings sloan author sloan jr kenneth r and david meyers and christine a curcio title reconstruction and display of the retina booktitle proceedings graphics interface vision interface address vancouver canada pages month may year techreport curcio b author christine a curcio and kenneth r sloan and david meyers title computer methods for sampling reconstruction display and analysis of retinal whole mounts number tr institution department of computer science university of washington address seattle wa month december year article curcio author christine a curcio and kenneth r sloan and david meyers title computer methods for sampling reconstruction display and analysis of retinal whole mounts journal vision research volume number pages year ,1

 it s not a bad question i don t have any refs that list this algorithm either but thinking about it a bit it shouldn t be too hard take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on you say you have this algorithm already find the center of this circle the line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere repeat with the unused point and two of the original points this gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere s origin their interection is the center of the sphere the radius is easy to compute it s just the distance from the center to any of the original points i ll leave the math to you but this is a workable algorithm an alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere three pairs will form three planes intersecting at a point this might be easier to implement ,1

hi i m writing a program to convert dxf files to a database format used by a d graphics program i ve written my program stores the points of a polygon in ccw order i ve used d concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn does the dxf format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in cw or ccw its easy enough to convert but if i don t know which way they are stored i dont know which direction the polygon should be visible from if dxf doesn t handle this can anyone recommend a workaround the best i can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the dxf file one stored cw and the other ccw but that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed thanks in advance for any help ,1

 it should have been made fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get was a old style mhz cpu upgrade certainly this was mentioned on comp sys sgi on more than one occasion as being likely if our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either confused or less than honest ethical or somebody further up the chain inside sgi was misleading them there were versions although admittedly the came out at the same time as the over a period of years the chassis simply couldn t be pushed any further i d say years was a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and age getting the to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our minds to push it further and i know that was made clear almost from the day the started shipping we had one last kicker in the form of the elan graphics which made graphics versions over its lifespan which i also think is pretty good please by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support or sales on your concerns there should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that shouldn t last too long and doesn t seem to be what you are referring to yes the sales folks do get bonus s at the end of some all quarters but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren t what they need i m sure but nobody is forcing you to buy at end of quarter after all they don t get all that long a lead time either although certainly they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions may well influence the end product but that also is life in the industry we can t design systems that meet just their needs or we won t sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we don t have some niche products like reality engine but surely you don t expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period that s a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience with workstations microcomputers supported and parts available yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest i missed your first posting but as i say by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate i m sure but complaints aren t going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we hear similar things from more than one person site all of the above is as usual my personal opinion not sgi s ,1

hi i have a problem i hope some of the gurus can help me solve background of the problem i have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain i e the mesh is a mapping of a d bezier patch into d the area in this domain which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered the trimming loop is a set of d bezier curve segments for the sake of notation the mesh is made up of cells my problem is this the trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller cells bounded by the trimming curve segments if a cell is wholly inside the area then it is output as a whole else it is trivially rejected does any body know how thiss can be done or is there any algo somewhere for doing this any help would be appreciated thanks ani ,1

i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working code which i will also include the intersection of planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in graphics gems i doesn t work i may be misinterpreting of course i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations to get the planes i was taking the midpoint of the line from say p to p and setting the normal as the normalized vector from p to p these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems however the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all of my test points for different tests my matrix vector math is very rusty but it looks like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine i don t have but should be easy to find another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets of points and intersecting the normals from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect supposedly planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel ed thanks to all who answered so far ,1

 i agree with you about the upgrade path but i think i was fair the original posting complained about sgi coming out with newer and better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones and that dec did on statement i merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product market position share in so doing they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture and the only upgrade path is to replace the system and the particular system he was complaining about was in computer lifetimes relatively old on statement i felt dec s history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry average and that in my opinion sgi s history is better than dec s and what is dec doing with it s mips based decstation line are they going to abandon it for their alpha based line or provide an upgrade path to r s and tfp s and r s ,1

 no that s not what i was complaining about nor did i intend to suggest that dec was any better than sgi let me tell you about the lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can t be out buying new systems on a regular basis the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster s words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars now you ll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts spl,1

hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse multiverse is a multi user non immersive x windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user s viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn t support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can t but because i don t have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that s all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i ve provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp u washington edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse tar z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i e z buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management interaction o etc etc both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i ve certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive contributions criticisms is also encouraged to contact me anyone who hates it dev null and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living you know where to write thanks robert ,1

 please note the newsgroups recent discussion about xv s problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for bit xv e mail me for them any misundertanding of mine is understandable juhana kouhia clip deleted note that xv saves only bit rasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg to gif to jpeg quality also there s three kind of bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs there s two errors xv allows the saving of bit rasterized image as jpeg even the original is bit saving bit rasterized image instead of original bit should be a special case xv allows saving the bit rasterized image made with any quantizer the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases in saving the image if at all clip clip deleted it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that bit quantized rasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that as matter of fact i m sure when xv were designed bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for bit images only at that time but when bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support bit images that were not done and now we have the program violate jpeg design and any bit image format the program has human interface errors otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use deleted clip some new items follows clip i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly it actually gave image with bad artifacts i don t know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xv s best option is not very good idea i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant i m sure rle people gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it clip clip some minor bugs in human interface are key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when i m writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet i suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done ,1

first off thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the i assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for further enhancements to the motorola line rather than meted out to another company ah well i guess that s what i get when i assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner a spot version of quicktime is as has been stated the current version of the software the older version is and is on the horizon in the not too distant future back quite x by that it he quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies apparently the process of expanding each frame s image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processor intensive there are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to x size or increase to x size performance suffers dramatically don t know quicktime he lied quicktime is very cpu dependent he was probably confused by the fact that qt is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up the centris and quadras have similar cpus and will thus boast similar performance though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture having was i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw was i was using was one of the new codecs in v allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version could handle the centris i saw was a plain vanilla with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound and the software was movie player the qt player apple includes with the software ,1

 sean the exists sean i don t want to get into a mini war by what i am going to say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the centris you ll see why please no flames i reserve those for c s m a i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple had a booth there i walked by and they were showing real time video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies i think the quicktime they were using was the old one they digitized a guy talking there in x xx something it played back quite nicely and in real time the guy then expanded the window resized to x by xx in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn t fps or about fps anymore it dropped to like fps then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to fps then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra don t know what model to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii well i spoiled his claim so to say since a quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble and this wasn t even from the hardisk this was from memory could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the animation like supposedly macromind s accelerator don t misunderstand me i just want to clarify this but for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not i can claim x a tad more with overscan being done in colors in my computer not from the hardisk at fps with scala mm but i agree if we consider mpeg stuff i think a multimedia consumer low priced box has a lot of market i just think do would make it no longer cd i ,1

 look for edge inconsistencies consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one edge if p q is an edge then q p should not appear if both p q and q p appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that edge this is bad assuming warning warning warning that you have an otherwise acceptable surface you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge pick an edge p q and mark it as ok for each face f containing this edge if more than oops make sure that all edges in f are consistent i e the face should be p q q r r s s t t p flip those which are wrong mark all of the edges in f as ok and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially inconsistencies don t let the queue have both p q and q p remove an edge from the queue and go to if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose if step finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you lose otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent which means that all of the surface normals will either point in or out deciding which way is out is left as an exercise ,1

 this algorithm works well for me algorithm to attempt to find outward facing normals first mark all faces as unknown then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices pick an arbitrary face and mark it counter clockwise using the edge dictionary orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face and recurse for all surrounding faces consistently orienting the entire surface find the average of the vertices in this surface using that point calculate a volume measurement taking into account the face s orientation if the volume turns out to be positive assume the faces are oriented correctly if it is negative reverse their orientations mark them clockwise if any faces are still unknown after this choose another face and go through the algorithm again at the end faces marked clockwise must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found note if you are running on silicon graphics machines and buy the iris inventor d toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm see usr src inventor tools ivnorm if you re not sorry i can t give out the source and even if i could it relies heavily on inventor ,1

hi everyone since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from points i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset for example given points on the offset can you find the original ellipse analytically i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year but i failed under the pressure i had to use other method nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately any ideas will be greatly appreciated please post here let the others share our interests ,1
 ok i don t use cview anymore but i saw that no one had explaind this bug in the thread so here goes it is not the fault of cview it is dos if you leave a file open on a floppy drive then change the disk and do something which updates or closes that file you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and fat from the other disk written to the new disk this has always been true and has destroyed data under other programs not just cview the only thing cview can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave files open unless it s actively using them ie reading and decoding ,1

hi to all out there we have this problem and i m not certain i m solving it in the correct way i was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point me in the right place to look we have an x ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube s axis image x ray source screen metallic tube we know source screen centre distance radius of the tube radius of the hole we do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen however the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the object s hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen however it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse i cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is do i have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation how do i do this transformation secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the source screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen how can i compensate the ellipse s axis for this image distortion so please can anyone give us a few pointers here how do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen we d appreciate any help either posted or emailed thanks in advance simon ,1

some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction ie on a closed cube all normals point outwards you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter clockwise order how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a set of points edges and faces say that you had a cube with all faces that have their normals facing outwards except for one face what s the best way to realize that face is flipped and should have it s points re ordered i thought i had a good way of telling this but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a d polygon i d like something for d data any hints tips references would be appreciated steve,1

 here at lewis and clark college we have recently installed a digital film system based on the mac quadra that does non linear full digital editing if you re considering such a system here are the pros and cons for the educational environment this system is excellent we use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network because this programming is going to be viewed on other macs the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the net we also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the lewis clark community since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use image quality is not critical the digital film system for those of you who are uninitiated is an a b roll digitizing system on one jpeg compression card it was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with svhs quality supermac the maker of the card is trying to achieve this quality level but as yet has been unable to deliver our system produces near vhs quality at fields per second x overscan the card repeats every other field to get fields per second this results in a kind of super film look that some find distracting if you can get past this problem you ll find the adobe premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work it produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to dve transitions to color matting because of its non linear nature editing is fast and easy if you ve ever used or seen used an avid or montage system you ll recognize the methodology and the user interface the total system with quadra megs of ram gig drive apple mon itor panasonic svhs edit deck audio gear cassette cd eq mixer etc composite monitor digital film card will set you back about for you video cowboys and girls this system will not output at a quality that will satisfy most of your clients even though you can perform more effects than a toasterhead can imagine an amiga based off line based system will look better we use both macs and amigas for our video work each for what each does best ,1

about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area ,1

let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems thanks ,1

 i think you may be chasing the wrong problem i don t think it is the function overloading at all i do that sort of thing all of the time in bc without a hitch the big problems i have encountered in porting mfc to bc is that fact that mfc depends on a couple of invalid c assumptions i have never gotten the entire ctrltest app to run under bc but the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static global objects are initialized i e some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized the problem is in the owner draw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all other pieces of ctrltest work fine two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc the cfile openflags enum uses hard coded numbers for the open mode rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl h which differ between msc and bc all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place of a reference to a derived object true for pointers not for references i am sure there are other problems along the same lines but i have not encountered them yet i have not seen mfc yet but i hope that some of these will be addressed if they are not all of ms s hype about portability to other vendor s compilers will be just that ,2
as the subjects says windows keeps crashing givinh me gpf on me of late it was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every day the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie i can t reproduce crashes and they are not always gpf s in the same application sometimes i can recover by simply closing the application that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and i need to re boot some background i have a leading edge sx with phoenix bios when i first got it it had mg of memory it ran windows fine not too many gpf s then a couple of weekends ago i installed lotus for windows with atm a game card and an additional mg simms the leading edge machine is kind of strange in that it has the ide controler built into the motherboard the cpu is actually on a sparate board that plugs into the motherboard and the simms it uses are macintosh simms apparently i was told that the leading edge had the parity bit built into the mother board the original mg ns simms where of the chip variety from samsung and the ones i installed are chip simms they are recognized fine by the bios ram check the game card is a generic gamecard the reason why i mention the hardware like this is that sometimes rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl alt del still leaves the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesn t i haven t tried taking out the ram or the game card because as i said these gpf are not reproducible at will i have gone through and entire day using the computer with no problems and then i might get or so gpf s in the sppace of minutes what can i do this situation is most annoying are there any good diagnostic tools for hardware do you think that this might be a software problem ie emm etc if it helps i have manage to get gpf s on after dark quicken paint shop pro a lot of them have been in user exe or gdi exe any help is truly appreciated eric,2

i edited a few newsgroup from that line don t like to crosspost that much i can t compare the two but i recently got an hp deskjet i m very pleased with the output remember that i m used to imagens laser and postscript printers at school looks very good you have to be careful to let it dry before touching it as it will smudge the deskjet is slow this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned i have no idea how the bubblejet compares the interface between win and the printer is just dandy i ve not had any problems with it hope that helps some cindy cindy tittle moore,2

you have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in windows than in dos regardless of what communication software you are using try the following turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to the cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters use a different uart for your serial line the old uart s or can only buffer one character internally the new uart s can buffer which should be plenty for most situations you can run windows msd exe to find out what uart is on the machine ,2
 first of all without wanting to sound nagging and bossy yes it is a trivial answer and that s perfectly fine otherwise how is one supposed to move up to the complicated and challenging questions we net readers so much enjoy and the massive crossposting of your article was not justified please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time by the way c o msw misc is ok now as far as your problem is concerned try playing around with the settings in the fonts dialog box under the window control menu that little square at the top left corner of the window ,2

 no when the program is run it loads configuration files autoexec bat config sys win ini and system ini there is no open entry on the file menu you can only edit these four files if you need to edit some other program s ini file use notepad or some other ascii editor i wonder whether microsoft intended for sysedit to be used or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out the reason i think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program and there is no online help for it just an about entry under the file menu the program looks like something that was intended for internal use only it s kind of a shame though it would have made a nice multi file replacement for notepad ,2

we have a lan where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms for the moment we are only working on mac and dos windows the department has always used sneaker net to transport files to the mac since it requires a filter to strip out the lf characters until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate and as a result the programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together at the end of each week so that a new system could be build we are now trying to streamline this process but are hampered by the lack of software that will allow us to share files across pc and mac platforms i understand that pvcs used to do this but that they no longer support the mac product anyone know why polytron i have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms so i assume that ours is not a new problem who has had to deal with it what solutions have you come up with thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or email if there are enough email responses then i will post a synopsis of the knowledge charles emmons ,2

a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart appears on the list of objects i m offered i looked around all the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the windows directory it turned up in a file called req dat or reg dat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didn t feel inclined to edit it i d welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers ,2

this is the official request for discussion rfd for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january and never taken to a vote the proposed groups are described below name comp os ms windows nt setup status unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt name comp os ms windows nt misc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous non programming discussions about using windows nt including issues such as security networking features console mode and windows win compatability rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os the family ranges from modular windows through windows and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end to date microsoft has shipped over beta copies and pre release sdks of windows nt the actual release is slated for may june while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win api includes the win api used in win dows and the win s api subset win less threads networking and security can be used to create bit applications for windows the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows with the addition of logins and a few other features it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows apps and nt also runs existing applications thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family comp os ms windows apps comp os ms windows programmer tools comp os ms windows programmer misc comp os ms windows programmer win the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows comp os ms windows announce comp os ms windows advocacy in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows and windows nt and yet operating systems such as os macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies further windows is due for a major rewrite itself in when the fully bit protected mode and with dos built in next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions discussion period the discussion period will run from april to may voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around may based on the feedback received during the discussion period no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv ,2

 try this flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the mouse ball in place remove the ball and inside you should see probably rollers if any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked on dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully scrape it off with a small knife xacto works great be careful you do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are i clean a couple of dozen of these every month here another symptom is that when you move the mouse it seems to click along if this doesn t solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse i highly recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak place it in your drawer every night or when you don t use it to keep the dust off personally i prefer track balls oh which brings me to another point if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is streaming through the window onto your mouse trackball you may notice that it will stop working if this happens to you close the curtains or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps ,2

 atm will do nothing for your truetype fonts if your truetype fonts are sufficient for your needs don t run atm i have a lot of fonts that i can install either as type postscript under atm or as truetype i have noticed that truetype font files are at least larger than their type equivalents if you are using a disk compressor though be aware that truetype fonts will compress whereas type fonts will not they are encrypted with a dpi laser printer the artificial bold version of a truetype font is indistingishable from the original forcing me to install the actual bold and bold italic etc variants if i want to use them type postscript fonts under atm generate a visually distinct bold variant from the base font i realize that the artificial bold font that atm generates is aesthetically inferior to the hand generated bold truetype variant but it is sufficient for my needs and not having to install bold variants saves me on disk space uncompressed ,2

help i am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language characters in this case norwegian i have been manipulating the data with excell and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable files to an rs workstation the norwegian characters show up fine under windows but appear as funny characters on the workstation the workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem entering the norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard on further investigation i found that the character codes used by windows are different for these characters than those specified by the msdos code page the msdos codes seem to be the same as the workstation what gives and how can get around it please reply by e mail as i will be out of the office the next few days and will not be reading the news thanks ,2

 windows nt is a giant windows operating system unline win it does not run on top of dos it is its own os with billy gates assures us true multi tasking multithreading meets dod security specs will run win programs as well as dos programs has multi processor support and is primarily a server program it s overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users speaking of overhead it requires at least a with megs of ram it iwll run with but that s like running os with megs and that s just to run it also i have heard that the system files take up megs and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig the skd is distributed on cd rom chicogo is what i want to use it is like nt a true os with thrue multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements and does not meet dod security specs but that s okay since it will probably be more of a client os there are a few otehr differences but those are the main ones there was an article about chicogo in pc week last august the chicogo and nt development groups at micro oft are in intense competition so it is said however i think a different relationship will arise nt will be the server n etowrk t echonology chicogo will be the client machine it is entirely possible for different os s to work together partly because chicogo is just a small nt think of it that way anyway novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos so don t scorn the concept anyway don t expect it soon windows and dos are supposed to be released next year read see it in so i expect that chicogo won t be out til with luck i ll be proven wrong rob,2

 this is a common problem with highly complex truetype fonts microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the postscript printer driver but i ve found it to be pretty generic you can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter outlinethreshold in the truetype section of win ini this entry specifies the number of pels per em at which windows will render truetype fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts the default is i ve generally been able to get fonts to work by setting outlinethreshold depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using you may need a different value the windows resource kit warns against going above presumably that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something i m not smiling ,2
help i m bored with the current windows backgrounds we have here and am looking for some nifty pictures to use instead i ve seen from previous posts that many sites exist that store pictures available through anonymous ftp except that i can t ftp to remote sites from my machine what i can do is use ftpmail mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files and or data back does anyone know of sites with windows compatible pictures that can be accessed in such a way if you do would you please post them tia mark ps maybe this would make a useful faq,2

 one difference will probably be the same difference as between os and windows x now one will likely have a lot of software available for it and one won t emulation with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims just doesn t count when you have to use a certain software package that doesn t quite run properly under the emulation developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully marketed regardless of its relative sophistication will win ,2

 lines deleted this list appears to imply that ms windows that has a cost listed above at comes with a c compiler c and fortran it does not of course these are expensive add ons that drive the price way beyond i don t know if the same applies to os as far as unix is concerned there is a free unix linux that has cc c fortran f c xwindows and many other features besides with a large number of utilities that can be optionally added and there is also a free bsd i believe both these unix s are quite robust you can check out comp os linux if you don t want to throw our many down the tubes you ve got to break that list down a little more ,2

hello i m investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework i have come across a few that look good zapp from inmark zinc from zinc software c views from liant win from blaise some considerations i m using being new to windows programming i m from the unix x world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important however since i m not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one i don t believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable since we will be developing for the bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows api are less important we will probably buy another c class library something like tools h or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff allocators etc so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media i was wondering if anyone had any first hand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are zapp seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes has new fancy d style controls available and support for custom controls has a windows nt version essential redirectable graphics display output architecture useful for printing sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system zinc has a platform independent resource strategy not too important for me right now comes with a interface builder tool has a windows nt version essential seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version had a better demo both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated thanks brett harper ,2

request for information i have been reading about an organisation called winword developer s relations group i believe they have produced publications called winword software development kit or wordbasic sdk and the proceedings of the windows developers tools conference wordbasic sessions assembled by steve wexler would you be able to help me with a contact name and address for this organisation or these publications thank you ,2
 have you tried setting files in your config sys file to a fairly high number i ve got mine set to i ve seen numbers from to recommended also check your stacks statement stacks is a good starting point try increasing it if it s already set there such as to stacks etc both stacks and files have been identified as one cause of frequent win crashes ,2
 since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character based apps but graphics based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu this is how things are shaping up everywhere client server architectures are taking over from the old cpu terminal setups note that the next does this you can always telnet into a next and run character based apps but you can t run the gui yeah i know about x windows just haven t been too impressed by it ,2
 i just got mathcad and the manual is not clear on the matter on page at least megabytes of memory all memory about k should be configured as xms at least megabytes of virtual memory common sense suggests that you should be able to run it but the new mathcad is kinda kooky and thus is not subject to the laws of common sense dan ,2
 yep it s called os ,2
in comp os ms windows misc you write you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation but i can t guarantee that i m not way off base the permenant swap file is read written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spart par in your windows directory that points to that file it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file compressed disks are actually logical disks these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used i e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i don t know if it does or doesn t but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dos tsr s disk compression and bios in order to be access i e never use a temporary swap file never more on permenent swap files i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size windows will only use the size suggested do you wan t to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers they also said that under absolutely no circumstances none will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size well that s what he said i call bull if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it s not going to use it any takers james,2

hi there we are running a node token ring with windows and novell every once in a while we run into the black screen of death a phrase coined by robert x cringely in a recent infoworld column basically sometimes when you quit windows the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen also sometimes when you exit to dos the same effect occurs cringely hints that microsoft and or novell has a patch for windows virtual interrupt controller that may solve this neither company seems to know what i am talking about when i call them has anyone else noticed this phenomenon is there a fix for it any response is welcome ,2

codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql q e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsoft s odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and q e only odbc quadbase rbase and q e have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsoft s odbc looks very promising it s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say it s available via ftp except it s effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmer s reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesn t actually interpret sql and liase with databases that s up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also it s windows only it s actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless it s a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future here s my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is which is fully compatible with ack paradox why the versions are different i don t know pd engine was compatible with pdox and it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box it s borland paradox engine database frameworks works with any borland c c mocrosoft c or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal or later tp for windows or later for framework applications bc or later or ms c c it does have support for object useage i haven t had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete i m planning to use it this summer rick borland has a product which is called paradox engine i do not know about ms the paradox engine i know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for sql but it will enable you to save and restore records has locking et al supposedly the paradox for windows was impemented on top of it charles parker phone technical support centerline software inc fax cparker centerline com cyberspace momma don t let yer children grow up to be cowboys i know borland has a library of routines for accessing paradox from within a c program they recently came out with version this works with both borland and microsoft s c compiler shailesh bhobe att psp smb ms has put their odbc sdk into the public domain it s big i believe mb but worth downloading over a fast link look at ftp uu net in vendor microsoft odbc sdk also some companies are starting to provide sql engines i just got one for rbase not exactly cheap at but it allows programs in c or vbasic under dos or windows to talk to data bases using sql functions in your code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf fnal fnal gov check out the odbc toolikt from microsoft it is available on ftp uu net vendor microsoft odbc sdk this is the way that we ve chosen to access databases from all of our apps mj borland sells the paradox engine which is a c language interface to paradox dbase btrieve ans asci files they also sell database frameworks which includes the engine plus a collection with source of c classes for using the engine earl roethke eroethke ems cdc com i actualy have paradox engine it is a library of functions large model for accessing the paradox s databases it seems to be working fine but i never did try it thouroughly it costs hope it will help you from david lefebvre david hp speedware com borland provides a database lib called paradox engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things gary bell nellads cc monash edu au paradox engine is the library for paradox artur babecki artur ii uj edu pl borland sells the paradox engine which has all the paradox calls in it its hardly sql though you can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts updates i m currently using it i have an eval copy and i ve linked it in to some entry screens i ve written the engine library adds about k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borland s vroom manager now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they don t really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out if you have any other questions let me know mike kamlet mike vpnet chi il us yes borland sells their paradox engine separately it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version of the engine which i have costed at egghead they now have version of the engine and a separate c class package for it michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk kentrox com uunet kentrox michaelk i ve used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox to access paradox files from c its pretty good not sql though have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly hope this helps good luck chris from fernand slinky cs nyu edu christopher fernandes borland sells their paradox engine it s a library of functions for accessing paradox db files it comes with libraries for ms c bcc turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascal win libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff being dll s when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine i don t know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid something like for an upgrade from the earlier version though hope this helps david taylor if you want to do sql from within your programs check out quadbase i don t have their address oops yes i do quadbase systems inc lucerne dr sunnyvale ca usa phone voice fax ask for the sql win demo disk it looked good to me i have a background in embedded sql in ingres this looked real similar it s a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that ll probably run about us good luck best tom delosh from delosh emunix emich edu tom delosh borland has the paradox engine library it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under dos windows but for paradox i believe you d have buy have the sql link since pdox itself isn t sql compliant i ve used the engine for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it under dos it s a real pig it tacks on about k to the size of your programs tim ma associate programmer university of utah email tim src cppa utah edu i don t know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for c c pascal in one package and if you want dbase compatible files there is a library called codebase from sequiter software that works with c c from davidr rincon ema rockwell com david j ray we re using q e database libraries to do what you describe it s a set of dll s accessed through a common api to talk to most of the major database formats we re using it to build an application that queries several databases using sql queries all access using q e is done using sql the package is available through microway in melbourne i believe it is produced by pioneer systems in the us we have no association with microway or pioneer systems other than being satisfied customers feel free to mail me for further information chris programming for nsw national parks and wildlife service chris hutchinson box u research programmer university of new england chris sulaw law su oz au armidale nsw paradox engine provides a complete set of c libraries for accessing paradox tables however it seems that it supports only borland turbo c and microsoft c when i tried to compile the engine s sample applications with the waterloo watcom c c bit compiler it complains that the library file llibce lib is missing even though i am quite certain that the file is not part of watcom c or the engine anybody have any success with other c compilers ron k ng hydro on ca i m currently developing an app with borland s paradox engine for c it also comes in pascal which has recently gone to version i e px engine is compatible with paradox and downward compat w there are indeed c libs for fox access but i can t think of the names offhand i m sure someone has already written you in that regard i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the c users journal which is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way i ve been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of px eng over the past year wouldn t recommend it for a complex multiuser app but i m staying with it for now it s like a bad marriage i ve got too much time invested in learning and work arounds but if your interest is limited to a simple single user interface you want to build your own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily it doesn t sound like you ll be bumping into any of the gotchas if you do write me i may be able to point you in the right direction from raymond cruzio santa cruz ca us raymond borland has a paradox engine and database framework which gives you a c and assembler api to paradox databases this is

 it certainly is multi user what i have seen from the march beta is that it doesn t yet come with the stuff which exploits multi user features i remember somebody from ms stating that it doesn t allow two users share one gui my interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and rpc based stuff you want i believe ftp and rlogin deamons for nt systems will come from third party somebody already has a beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net there is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on unix for remote logins in general i liked nt when i checked it out it slow compared to win just like any other real os the beta version although being slow botts up much faster than my sun workstation windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than x windows i believe bill gates was right when he stated that nt was not for everybody after playing around with it for a while i was convinced if i owned a busines using a business computer from ibm or some other established vendor i would consider moving to nt platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution if you are running sql servers etc it provides the robustness such an application requires on the other hand if you like your dos games more or less forget about nt you can always boot to dos but in general that defeats the purpose of using nt most of nt s features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can t reboot your machine at will for personal use i would rather wait for the win based windows release whatever you name it than jump to nt bandwagon i expect most applications will keep on using win until win becomes widely available ,2

 if you need just to change the wallpaper then i ve written a short program in vb that does this by using systemparametersinfo function the bad news is that you need vbrun dll to run it and the dll is some kb the program is about kb the order of pictures depends on the system date and the number of bmp files in the directory so the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times during the same day and the number of bmps has not changed if you feel this is what you need then i could uuencode it and email it to you it is unavailable via ftp ,2

i am using dos quick c in a dos window under windows and the other day while i was running the compiler i got a general protection fault immediately followed by a serious disk error when i rebooted i found that about files had gotten cross linked which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system i am concerned that quick c in a dos window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem i thought that dos programs run in dos windows were pretty well contained by windows if that is true then maybe the quick c compiler has nothing to do with it has anybody else had this type of problem i only recently upgraded from quick c to brad banko ,2

 the key issue that i bought my bj on was ink drying speed you really have to try awful hard to get the bj ink to smear the hp deskjets need seconds to completely dry in both cases however do not get your pages wet unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not toner but that should go without saying i think the ink now used in the deskjet family is water fast i ve had pictures ruined by a few drops of rain these were colour pictures from a deskjet c mind you it could have been acid rain i use a bj ex ink dries fast but it really doesn t like getting wet ,2

i wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not i can create a bitmap of any size i followed the bitmap creation example in sdk manual and specified a x bitmap set the width height to and supplied a byte string with chars but i just cannot get the right bitmap image i changed the width height to x and used the same value string padded with zero byets to make up to the right size and got the image the example in the manual is x size which are multiple of bytes can you define a bitmap image of any size thanks very much g chen chen citr uq oz au,2

i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse com was using i think but switched to to see if it was any better vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can t click on something because my mouse jumps around i can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch this is crazy i have never had so much trouble with a mouse before anyone have any solutions does microsoft think they are what everyone should be just venting steam sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications d hfac brigham young university provo ut ,2

 hey sounds great does that mean that w wg works with odi i thought it uses ndis my problem is that lan workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my umbs so i d hate to have to load many more drivers to make w wg work along i read in a german computer magazine that tcp ip support for w wg is just around the corner anybody have any news about this regards richard ps i possibly caused a dupe with this message if this message was spread twice outside of munich please send me a short note it would help me debug my news application ,2
can somebody help me out there i have just purchased win and i just can t get dos apps text mode apps to run in a window on their own i ve tried mucking around with the pif settings etc but to no avail what am i doing wrong i didn t get this problem under v thanks in advance ,2
 stuff deleted well someone at microsoft told you wrong windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size last summer i went to a microsoft windows technical workshop and they distributed a lot of information that the general public might not be aware of anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on creating larger than recommended swapfile i ll quote the information if you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size you will receive a message telling you that windows will not use anything larger than the recommended size this error message is incorrect we will allow the use of the larger swapfile up to four times the amount of ram on your machine so as you see microsoft does know that the information is incorrect you probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew be that what it may i would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these technical workshops they aren t actually incredibly in depth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know besides that they offer you huge discounts on software if i remember correctly you could pick up word excel or whatever their presentation program is for that is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational version you could also pick up microsoft office for or something like that myself i sprang for word well hope that was helpful to someone and besides that i hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money and if anyone at microsoft is reading this i really love your products i need a job once i graduate also can we work something out ,2
this probably is in a faq somewhere but i m looking for microsoft s internal speaker sound driver for windows should be at microsoft s ftp site but i can t remember the name of the site ,2

hi my last question for the year i have a mail order no name notebook with meg ram i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview but win and w w constantly crash on me most commonly citing a memory parity error the only thing i can do is turn off and re boot my cmos ticks off counts all the memory every startup and there is never a problem with this either could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware i remember having some disk error problems when installing it is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening i think win vs win s produce different crashes but both crash frequently nonetheless ,2
hi there i m having a bizarre video problem within windows i have a with a gvga video board i ve been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it s screen the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you don t have any problems until you get back to windows however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly also it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains it s original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple ish black if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the screen gets refreshed again if i don t log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again when that didn t work i tried reloading windows to no avail any thoughts on things to check out i am totally baffled thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction ,2

 so good that there isn t any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies and tt there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm otherwise it is a waste of system resources or if you need to use a service bureau and they re only set up to use type fonts from what i ve heard pure hearsay the results of outputting tt fonts as type is not as good as using high quality type fonts in the first place unless you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter a problem with tt fonts in windows is that they do get converted to t format ok and the hinting is even used while this is done but the resulting t fonts are not hinted the result is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the ps file is generated but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution ,2

 that isn t enough to change your windows startup logo vgalogo rle is not needed after you have installed windows it is incorporated as a part of win com to make a new win com you have to concatinate three files together using the b option for a binary concatonation i beleive it is copy b win cnf vgalogo lgo vgalogo rle mywin com make sure you backup your win com file in anotehr directory before you do this i absent mindedly typed win com instead of mywin com and had to resinstall windows anyway substitute whatever rle file you want the win cnf has the info needed to start windows think of it as a bootstrap and vgalogo vga has video information just make sure that the rle file doesn t tip the whole com file size over the k limit of a com file so anyway i use mywin com to startup ms windows now instead of that annoying micro oft advertisment i have the joker yes from batman taking yoru picture from the screen saying smile also a little bit of text micro oft windows the world s first commercially sucessful virus i added that because of the frequency of crashes grin rob,2

to all hardware and firmware gurus my current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a physically handicapped relative of mine my goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an at sytle keyboard to its host system this will be a highly endowed keyboard with a little pcl from z world at its heart the only thing i lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the with windows and dos will be expecting my project is independant of windows my hope is that some of you fellow window s users programmers will recognize what i need and be willing to point me in the right direction i have the winn l rosch hardware bible nd edition the hb gives most if not all of the information i will need concerning scan codes and even a wire diagram for the ps style connector i will need but it leaves a number of important questions unanswered is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication i m guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock in either event how is the data framed is it half duplex or truly one way i m guessing half duplex since the host can turn leds on and off are there any chipsets available for communicating with the at keyboard standard other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard if anyone knows of a book or article or any other written source of information on the above please advise me at gamet erg sri com whatever i do it must be safe for i cannot afford to replace the in the event of a booboo thank you for your time danke fuer ihre zeit ,2
 pc magazine january had a review of several personal finance management programe as did pc computing january pc world december also had articles about quicken and managing your money i can email you copies of these articles if you can t find them at your library i ve been using managing your money for several years and i have several friends who use quicken though i ve not used it myself my overall impression is that quicken is a financial accounts manager while managing your money will help you more completely manage your finances here are some features that i believe managing your money and quicken share the ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts checking savings charge cash or brokerage you can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps the ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget a checkfree module which will allow you to use the checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem the ability to print checks on your printer the ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments the ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date i know managing your money can do this automatically via modem quicken probably can as well but i m not sure about it the ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs here are some features that i believe managing your money has that quicken does not a tax prediction module this looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year it s usefull to fine tune your withholding so uncle sam doesn t get his due too early an insurance and vital records module this is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records it can also compute your life expectancy a financial analysis module this computes compound interest effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and loan amortization schedules it also has functions to help you decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether a particular investment s cash flow is adequate for your situation this module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition a net worth module this is a place to record all your assets and liabilities your net worth can be computed from this information any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here a desk module this includes a small word processor a card file you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a rudimentary calculator a to do list a reminder list an appointment list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to track such things your appointments reminders and to do list can be made to display automatically when you start the program there are probably some things listed above that quicken has but i m almost sure that quicken doesn t do everything i ve listed if i m wrong i m sure hordes of quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp one thing that quicken has that managing your money does not yet have is a windows version meca software is rumored to be working on a windows version of managing your money for release late this year ,2

we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w wg for a while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcp ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that s what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i don t know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only for one support call until problem is worked out phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew please drop me a note anyone the next itteration is supposed to have tcp ip built in they say the netxt itteration of w wg good luck ,2

hi we ve been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer dmp or laser i have used works and windows write the output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output but anything fancy garbles or just doesn t output the exception is outputting to a lserjet which appears to be fast enough receiving data not to bother about handshaking messages i m sure i m not alone in this i ve tried most of the print network manager options i can think of anyone had similar problems they ve cured and would like to tell me bout it thanks,2
walther i d have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering i d only suggest using the color screen if it does without flickering if this is not too small for your tastes at a personally i d prefer the mono screen as i always have quite a few windows open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color surplus is worth trading in the smaller size if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors i used a mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen ,2
mornin all i was wonderin i got screenpeace the screensaver which i think is very good and i got a problem with it there is an option there realize colour table and if it s switched on some wallpapers colours will get ucked up with some screensavers e g the flashlight one if i turn it off however it works well and it s faster so i have it off all s nice and well however if i turn it off then it will be on again next time i start windows all the setting are set in the win ini file and i do have save settings on exit selected also i tried manually changing the setting in the win ini file to n for no realize colour table and started windows it will be fine for that session but the next session will again turn the option on i tried adding a r read only attribute to my win ini file and it worked but my bitmap wallpaper saver didn t work then actually it s the same application anywya it didn t work since it must change the setting at the win ini file so anyone out there got any answers suggesions comments for me thanks i a mickey aka mp,2

 not true both type and tt fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size it all depends on the font s maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed probably the reason for your opinion experience that tt is inferior is because most tt fonts on the market today have been converted from type outlines to tt either by the font vendor or end users using fontographer or fontmonger instead of the tt fonts being hand hinted to take advantage of the tt hinting language at best these converted tt fonts will be on a par with the type font of its orgin truetype is a much richer and more robust hinting language than type the hinting of diagonals for instance which tt does and type cannot if you check out the windows core fonts times arial courier symbol wingdings you ll see what can be done with tt there are other fonts out there that have been hand hinted and not just converted some of the microsoft tt font pack fonts are hinted very well again not true the characters in a tt or type font depend on the maker if someone converts a type font to tt they ll only get the characters in the font of orgin tt allows for much more flexibility in this area as well you can have thousands of glyphs in a tt font file mac ps windows unicode char set and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on for instance all or our fontpack tt fonts have the mac windows char set in them the metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set hope this clears up some of the confusion feel free to contact me if anyone would like more info regards ,2

i ve never had quicken but i did use mym in it s early days i have ms money for windows now and a financial planning package called wealthbuilder by reality technologies and money magazine p s i also do my taxes with turbo tax all of these packages are good in their own way but none of them really support me in doing what i really need to do manage my finances the first company that comes along with a windows based package that manages budgets and accounts manages loans calculates taxes uses all of the above and knowledge about my investing philosophy to help me invest in the right investment vehicles and integrates it all together will have my business for life ,2
are there any workspace managers out there for windows by a workspace manager i mean something like the hp apollo workstations have multiple workspaces under x there is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces it overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen instead you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens and you can flick between them thanks in advance ,2

 hi i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the two products i am however a devoted quicken user and i can tell you how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions first use the memorize feature ctrl m to record the recurring transactions next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used i e monthly quicken will can not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once additionally if you are using the bill minder it will remind you when each transaction group is due for example you could have three transaction groups one for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month and one for quarterly payments i hope this helps ,2

i have a modest system of aliases macros that enables me to download mail from a public access unix system to my ms dos box i read and reply to the mail with a ms windows based editor everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has maintained his text at col max width sometimes i get slightly wider messages that run off screen so i have to use the cursor slider to read the whole thing i m using ndw deskedit mainly but i ve experienced the same prob with all other ms windows editors i ve fiddled with word wrap settings in the various editors but to no avail i know i m missing something very basic in editor setup but what is it oh yeah ms word for windows converts everything flawlessly but for what i m looking for that s like using a tank to crack walnuts i d really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming ascii files in a readable format to my screen thanks in advance ,2
does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for windows for the panasonic kx p i pin dot matrix printer ,2
 this is silly is unix a mature os depends on who you ask and how you define mature system is if anything less mature than windows so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under the apple menu everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of the program manager if you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available and this is easy on a mac give me a break having spent hours moving system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time i find this laughable oh great ever hear of aliases wonder why apple implemented them eh i don t follow why is it that i find the mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever i use it yeah right you post flame bait yet ask for no flames ,2

 ummm i think you left the message out i get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work a mhz with mb ram windows with dos at home on a mhz mb ram windows and dos i never get these any idea what could be wrong someone already suggested i check for tmp files in the windows temp directory there are none there the message i get is this application has violated system integrity due to an invalid general protection fault and will be terminated i only have this problem with applications running in dos boxes with or without pif files setup for them any hints help greatly appreciated please post since at least one other person is also having gpf problems thanks gordon ,2
 hello i recently tried to print some envelopes using amipro with my deskjet printer and i seem to be having a problem what happens is after i physically load the envelope into the printer per the user manual and then select the print envelope icon from amipro all of the proper options have been selected the printer just spits out the envelope without any printing of either a return address or the selected mailing address at this point the printer s online light begins to flash and the print manager shows the printer job as busy this is all that happens until i either shut the printer off or cancel the printing job from the print manager i have also tried this without the use of the print manager with similar results amipro shows the printer as being busy so does anybody have any idea solution regarding this problem i appreciate the help thanks yes ignore the manual just insert the evelope don t use the keypad to move it up the windows driver sends a message to the printer that tells it to load the envelope if it is already loaded it gets ejected and the printer tries to load another the instructions in the manual are for dumb dos apps that don t send the load envelople message tom belmonte,2

i have been experiencing several end user problems with various commercial software packages wordperfect win publish it win and printing landscape mode on a citizen pn the little guy or the citizen gsx in a nutshell the problem is that i lose the first inches of information from my left margin be it white space or truetype font output and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first wordperfect had a workaround consisting of using the default location for the printers instead of tractor or manual they have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it ms write of course has no problem with these printer drivers proving that microsoft knows something the rest of us don t are you surprised i m not publish it win is still investigating this problem and while i was consider my options rejecting the one about buying an dtp package for surely they wouldn t have this problem right i stumbled onto a global workaround workaround go into the windows control panel select printers select your citizen printer driver select setup and select a custom size of x like magic all of your problems will go away ask me no questions and i ll tell you no lies mike disclaimer my opinions do not necessarily reflect those of my employer ,2
i m looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a dos app basically i have several dos apps that i use now and then with different files they all accept a file as a command line parameter but the only way at least that i know of to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the pif file so that it prompts me for additional parameters at which point i type in the file name problems are sometimes i can t remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager and i m lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried several directory levels deep if anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this i d appreciate it thanks tim the net isn t organized enough to be considered an anarchy,2

 from the windows resource toolkit for win workgroups add an entry to your system ini file under the nonwindowsapp section commandenvsize nnnn this sets the command com env size where nnnn must either be or between and a value of disables the setting if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to or down to if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were if you specify the environment size in a pif file for command com the pif setting overrides this setting the default is with msdos versions earlier than otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in config sys to set this value you must edit your system ini and reboot i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the config sys shell line and both give larger environments if you don t use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary ,2

a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems there seems to be a limit of characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database a a dde sql update command does not seem to work b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated i guess c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key strokes vb sends are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access ,2

reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment this is long i have mb of memory on my sx mhz an intel math coprocessor and a mb hard drive with mb free no compression i have been running mathcad under windows in enhanced mode with a mb ram drive mb mb smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months i am interested in the faster mathcad but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft s claim about increased speed to sx users will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by e mail appear to be by fuess llnl gov david a fuess according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a win s feature a figure of mb was indicated to me as a minimum but you might try anyway by bert tyler satalink com bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here i have a dx with mb of main memory less mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process which i have been running without any swapfile when i installed the win s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win s subsystem itself demanded the presence of a swapfile the only win s program i ve run to date is the bit version of freecell that came with that subsystem i gave windows a small temporary swapfile i m leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well by bca ece cmu edu brian c anderson what is win i upgraded to mathcad and it installed a directory for win under windows system during the upgrade it told me that win was required by case student tc umn edu steven v case mathcad makes use of the win s libraries you ve probably heard about win s it is a bit windows library that provides much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under windows by rhynetc zardoz chem appstate edu thomas c rhyne i also have mb of ram and indeed mathcad insisted on a permanent swapfile it would not run otherwise by bishop baeyer chem fsu edu greg bishop mathcad absolutely requires mb ram with mb swap file or mb ram with mb swap file it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than mb it is a major resource hog if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about mb of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the win s libraries so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft s advertisement for that you need a swap file possibly as big as mb looks like i would just need an mb swap file and would need to choose or can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file apparently a win subsystem ships with mathcad how much disk space does this require i also received these answers by mfdjh uxa ecn bgu edu dale hample if you ve got megs of ram why not configure megs as a ram disk for mathcad dos permits different bootup configurations can mathcad win be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i don t see how using dos for an alternate bootup would provide windows with this swap file some time back i remember a discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file but i thought this involved slower mb systems i have dos but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation by the way is a full installation of dos required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature which files from the installation disks are required by wild access digex com wildstrom presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if windows needs a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn t exist permanent is generally faster though i don t know why mathcad wouldn t be happy with either type ver is and so should any program conforming to the win specification ,2

 yes and the idea was ripped off from adobe which has had a program called typealign for a few years now typealign does the same thing for adobe type fonts and adobe has said that the next version will work with both adobe type and truetype and typealign does some things that trueeffects does not including some things you apparently want ,2
are you using windows or if you re still on devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently if you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with the windows resource kit or one of the many shareware ones available to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal graphics brush etc in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory area also some don t give it back when they re finished ,2
 common complaints about ms windows deleted hmmmm why do i get the feeling that this is gonna start one of those endless threads mac vs win and might even end up as os vs win well i dont know if windows is a mature os if i have seen one in which case that has to be x windows but dont be so quick to judge first of all to try to use plain vanilla windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla dos there are lots of very nice commercial and shareware packages utilities that will boost up windows past what ms itself thought possible for example norton desktop for windows a replace ment for progman will give you group within a group capability and will even change group icons it will launch progs by association well fileman does that too or by dragging the file in the apps icon now mac doesnt do that huh and the list goes on and on now windows is kinda hard to finetune boost and configure but thats trhe price to pay for not paying to get a mac or an os capable machine an entirely differet story on the other hand if you dont like the idea of pm s icons not correspnding to the files themselves well they are not supposed to pm is a program launching utility not a file manager modify your settings to have fm as your shell and not pm or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a mac feel i dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system mac s are good in their own way they are different not better or worse than win pcs actually i am writing this from a mac lab as a user assistant so dont think i am partial to win by all means check out the stuff in cica ftp to ftp cica indiana edu under the pub pc win subdir user anonymous or wait for startrek mac s os on a pc the threads we are gonna have then just trying to avoid another mac win war ,2

hi while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error i started to do this when i immediately got a serious disk error message from windows hit return to retry i did that about times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow i am including the chkdsk output below questions is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches what might have caused this does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable i m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things thanks for your comments and suggestions brad banko ps this is a sx machine with a mb hard drive and mb of ram chkdsk output volume serial number is d errors found f parameter not specified corrections will not be written to disk c gfx vpic cvpic exe allocation error size adjusted c gfx vpic vpic txt allocation error size adjusted c gfx vpic video cfg allocation error size adjusted c gfx vpic orcpro cfg allocation error size adjusted c gfx vpic vga cfg allocation error size adjusted c game goose bird x allocation error size adjusted c winmisc adv winadv exe allocation error size adjusted lost allocation units found in chains bytes disk space would be freed c gfx vpic cvpic exe is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic geno cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic tri b cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic ts hi cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic config doc is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic vpic txt is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic video cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic defincon cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic atiwondr cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic geno cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic oak cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic hires cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic aheada cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic vpic doc is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic orcpro cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic everx cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic wait com is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic maxxon cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic wait doc is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic everx cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic ega cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic config exe is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic readme st is cross linked on allocation unit c gfx vpic vga cfg is cross linked on allocation unit c game goose bird x is cross linked on allocation unit c windows system sound drv is cross linked on allocation unit c windows games grp is cross linked on allocation unit c windows mad bmp is cross linked on allocation unit c mage demo a kin is cross linked on allocation unit c mage demo b kin is cross linked on allocation unit c mage pkin exe is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc games dialword exe is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc games dialword txt is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc adv winadv wri is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc adv adv key is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc adv adv rec is cross linked on allocation unit c winmisc adv freezer is cross linked on allocation unit c spart par is cross linked on allocation unit c bng mbx is cross linked on allocation unit bytes total disk space bytes in hidden files bytes in directories bytes in user files bytes available on disk bytes in each allocation unit total allocation units on disk available allocation units on disk total bytes memory bytes free,2

chicago from what i have read is projected to run in m on and higher it is definitely aimed at the desktop it is rumored to offer preemptive multitasking multithreading but will not offer multiprocessing is bit and no reliance on dos it is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager dos is rumored to be similar to chicago but without the gui is also a step towards cairo the next generation os which is rumored to be object oriented i wonder where windows fits here is it a stepping stone to chicago hope this helps thx dave l ,2

from article apr samba oit unc edu by dil admin mhs unc edu dave laudicina you re using drivers version or earlier the latest is available from their bbs or by snailmail it at least fixes the wfw problem the reason i wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because of following i talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told that i can expect a new version near the end of the month which should be about now however i have a problem when switching back from a dos session in standard mode apparently they don t know of this problem and seem to be surprised why anybody would want to use standard mode at all it s a great card for the price at least when i bought it now there may be better alternatives ,2
 the has its own set of drivers you may be using the drivers intended for the or by mistake be sure you have the driver version don t quote me on this one but i d steer clear of the multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution without exiting windows i think it s buggy version drivers are due to be release by cirrus soon unfortunately their not available via ftp you have to dial up their bbs in the usa i do this from nz using a k modem to cut down on phone bills it took me around minutes to download the v driver good luck ,2

 the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than m ram eisa and vlb or m isa m should not be a problem for you nope i can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all non interlaced they aren t perfect but are much improved i don t recall the last time which i had to leave mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due to software incompatibility it s quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate i like it ,2

here is an annoying problem whenever i save an icon which contains dark colors like dark red or dark purple these colors are converted to the bright colors this happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with sdk i don t have this problem with bmp files either only with ico files or icon libraries the problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header checking the file with a binary editor i can see that the masks are ok by editing the colormap manually copying from another icon that i didn t edit i can fix the colors does anybody know what may be causing this problem thanks ,2

i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp cica indiana edu file is dr zip they re very recent i downloaded them from the cirrus bbs last night if you are unable to get them there email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well i have a local bus based card vl bitblaster from micron but i think the drivers work with isa cards or at least includes drivers for them i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the version improving my graphic winmarks v by about million to although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on cirrus s part but i don t think so from steve gibson s columnist for info world graphic card comparisons also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv zip i extracted the following for the sake of comparison wintach winbn word sprsht cad paint overall steve s system vlb ati graphics ultra pro my system sx vlb vl bitblaster its no viper but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson s review micron system owner s i would be interested to hear your opinions on the dtc vl local bus disk controller my system came with a maxtor drive mb and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about kb s i am now at kb s is this about as good as it gets i can t get a norton s sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at least that was what the program said ,2

 first off i haven t used w wg but i think that s about to change the problem is the lastdrive command and the way netware in general and in this case netx in particular adds drives to the device chain setting lastdrive z means there are no unassigned as opposed to unused drive letters for netware to use as it tacks its drive mappings onto the end of the existing list of drives w wg obviously attaches its network drives to existing unused drive letters i d guess the next thing i d try is something like lastdrive m which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for w wg and still allow up to netware drive mappings as well ,2
 i hope this will clear it up taken from one of my lecture notes the alternative approach to cisc which has been adopted by many in recent years has come to be known as risc the reduced instruction set computer this can be characterised simply as simpler is faster by simplifying the design e g by reducing the variety of instructions addressing modes the hardware can be designed to run faster even at the cost of needing more instructions the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler faster design a typical risc processor will o provide a large number of registers e g o perform all data operations on registers o provide few addressing modes e g immediate or register offset o only allow load store operations to access memory o only use a few instruction formats o only support a few data types e g integer unsigned floating ,2

i am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business the particular need in this case is for three machines each in a different office of the same building each having access to a windows based accounting system my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines likely a and two s along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit one additional user kit will be necessary it then seems logical to purchase a simple multi user accounting system along the lines of daceasy or m y o b and fire it all up the will more or less act as server with a report check printer attached to it cable runs of feet will be necessary for this setup well this all seems too easy to me would any of you network gurus out there tell me if i am out of my mind here any and all suggestions however trivial will be immensely appreciated my apologies if this has been brought up before thanks john john e martin jemartin nyx cs du edu university of puget sound kent wa formerly martin ups edu seinfeldsupersonicsrushbelafleck,2

 sorry i did nt tell exactly what i need i need a utility for automatic updating deleting adding changing of ini files for windows the program should run from dos batchfile or the program run a script under windows i will use the utility for updating the win ini and other files on meny pc s do i find it on any ftp host svein well in the latest windows magazine there is an advertisement for a program that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk uninstaller but it can be used to update a network but only for deleting not adding or changing their ini files uninstaller by microhelp inc i am also looking for an ini updater for my pc network and so far without any luck so for the time being i have been pushing dos and it s batch language to its limit look into dos s i am assumming that dos has the same command maybe even more or less improved replace command i use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch file that is run everytime they invoke windows this basically overwrites their color schemes but does what i need it to do not neat but does the job i m looking for a better solution though mike just relaying what i know a not for profit service ,2
hi have you used mac system x or x if the answer is positive you would know if ms windows is a mature os days ago people doubted that ms windows is not a real os i can see why they have such question ms windows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job for example you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group in a group if you know how please tell me too many system parameters to take care of uncomplete documentation it s not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error group deleting file deleting after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full of nonsense files share problem once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language w o good editor there will be a sharing problem you just can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to prevent from saving but not opening microsoft try to compromise between dos and windows but they just make ms windows a graphical dos with capacity doing mutiple dos jobs the worst thing is they complicate the environment the orginal purpose of ms windows should be to simplify the environment and make pc easier to use it s by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute no flame please ,2
 novell is at least demoing windows apps running under unixware try mks mks others esp emx note here the mks toolkit for dos windows os gives you a good suite of standard unix utilities there are other similar systems from other vendors as well the emx system for os gives you most of the standard unix system calls for recompiling your unix programs under os not quite the same thing as actually running unix programs directly in either case but emx makes os almost as compatible with unix systems as many unix systems are with each other and best of all emx is free there is a similar system go for dos but it doesn t work with windows as far as i know should add in the cost for dos with both geos and windows neither of which is a standalone os at this point neither os nor unix requires dos btw two of the best unices i ve seen for the pee cee are unixware for the personal edition and linux free so i don t agree that a good one costs and if you really want to check out the various options available to you you should also look into desqview and desqview x cheers,2

 two things that annoyed me about the pc magazine review their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed as was clearly shown by the graphite and gxe s cheating can t they just admit that their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and or cheat on wintach is much harder to beat the big cheat that hercules iit used was overlappipping bitblit and polyline optimization and hercules sent them a new driver which didn t do this but produced almost identical scores yet the only thing pc magazine says is that scores are not legitimate couldn t they at least make some comment about its real world performance i m not so much going by winbench for performance but rather by steve gibson s results which are more real world based like using micrografx despite these documented cheats i have to say that in real world applications the hercules graphite adapter actually draws faster than any other display adapter in the industry even though it s just a modest isa bus card it outperformed every local bus adapter i have including the stealth vlb the fahrenheit va vlb the ati vlb mach and even the weitek p based diamond viper vlb this kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it bogus winbench or not i already returned the ati gu my dealer had sold eight of them and seven were returned to him i m now temporarily back to running an original ati gu until i get my graphite and yes the gu is faster in my mb system than the gu especially in bitmap handling that s where you use bitblits hercules has a promotion available for vars and software developers you can buy one graphite or graphite vlb for off list to try it out at just for graphite or for the vlb version i decided it was worth trying i m supposed to get the vlb board within two weeks i ll post my impressions when i get it ,2

i am having something very unusual happen first some background on my system i have a mitsubishi meg hard drive and am running smartdrv the version that comes with windows on it i rarely use windows i use a program called disk technician gold v to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive it works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file or if there is anything else is wrong with it and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting my hard drive is notorious for bad sectors i usually end up with new bad sectors a week here s what happened i ran a program and dtg broke in with an emergency warning and recommended i reboot it gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded i exited the program and did just this dtg went through its bootup process examining for new errors etc and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time i then went back to the program executed it again and the exact same error was detected i rebooted and tried again and the same error happened again so i removed dtg from memory and went to the program to see if i could detect anything wrong sure enough there was a number of read attempts so i rebooted and reloaded dtg but removed the cache i executed the program no read errors either audible or detected by dtg i quit the program loaded the cache and ran the program again the errors were detected ok so the errors are there and dtg detects but doesn t fix them when the cache is loaded when the cache is not loaded there are no errors so to see if the cache was interfering with any other files i went into xtree gold and tagged all files and searched them for a random string in other words i wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive before i got through the c s dtg had detected at least six errors and recommended i reboot does anybody have any idea why smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive oh there are exactly two misreads per file and in about every files are affected i originally posted this message to disk technician corp s system but i figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out ,2
 one of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous non fragmented space i suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk in your case it depends on what you are running we had to increase our swap file i think it is now mb when some applications couldn t run without everything else closed ,2
hello is it possible to know minimize program manager when starting an application and to restore it when the application is ended if possible please tell me how to do it ,2
 are you using fastopen if you are disable it we had a lot of problems with fastopen corrupting weird things including the windows permanent swap file when we were using it indeed they are advanced personal measure tells me they are accessed just before shell dll i really like spinrite and qa plus,2

 i read this in an electronic magazine about nt and for all the hoopla about nt one would think the thing would be multi user but it s not it supports only one user at a time it can support multiple clients but only one actual user your mileage may vary this posting does not represent the opinions of my employers ,2

i m using an oak based vga card on my computer x x i ve downloaded the driver from ftp cica indiana edu and i ve had good luck with it however does anyone know if a faster driver is available for this card thanks mike,2
about kbyte without novell support no no nearly all we run mixed wnt beta and w wg no problem apart from printer sharing beta problem we had problems with mouse drivers using w wg where windows didn t seems to be more critical about it it was actualy a port problem with the network card running on x e we changed it to x now everything is allright i think it has to do with the ami bios as well ,2
 i contacted lotus about this problem today it has been reported previously and there is a fix apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame the work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding tab and use space to align the frame or use set frame where placed w no text wrap around unforutnately once the page run on has occured you are hosed so the moral of the story is use only space characters to align equation frames hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this problem ,2
an earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to winqvt net version realy where i tried archie with no luck it s probably just a typo but i sure would like to get one if it s real as i too have a printer problem in winqvt ,2
 dear friend the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not as orthogonal is cisc the original riscs had small instruction sets and simple ones the idea was that a every instruction should be completable in a single clock cycle and b to have no microcode and c extensive pipelines a few comparisons from patterson reduced instruction set computers cacm v cpu year instructions microcode ibm kb dec vax kb ibm ucb risc stanford mips while researching for the vlsi vax dec discovered that of the vax microcode is there to support of the instruction set which accounted for a mere of all instructions executed the uvax subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software emulator for these very complex instructions the full vlsi uvax included the entire instruction set was times more copmlex but only ranm faster cpu chips microcode transistors uvax k k vlsi uvax k k ,2

 hi the best sound conversion program i ve ever seen is soundtool which is shareware from germany i found a copy somewhere in wuarchive wustl edu a long time ago but i don t know offhand what directory it was under it s great at converting files of all types including mac next sun and various pc formats it s also a great player and editor with various special effects that put windows sound recorder to shame it requires a driver for various sound cards the only builtin one is for the pc speaker and even that sounds pretty good but if you re just using it to convert things you can convert them in soundtool and then play them in sound recorder give it a try bret,2
 no not really it may be that your winfile ini has gotten corrupted for some unknown reason have you tried re creating it by either exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar is visible or double clicking on the control menu the one with minimize and maximize in in when everything looks proper if you have and it still doesn t work you may want to delete your winfile ini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally recreate the file from scratch good luck mark waschkowski,2

hi i have a problem when using subscripts with msword the problem is the subscripted characters get cut off on the display but print out ok anyone know how to fix the subscripts so i can see them on the screen many thanks ,2
to clarify vc is considered an upgrade for c there will be no product called c although the command line compiler of vc lists its version as c is not a dos only product it is a c c compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows as is vc pro ed the significant difference is that vc comes with many windows hosted tools ide etc which assist developers in creating windows executables much more quickly basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code initial impressions have been very favorable everyone who is a registered user of c should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c if you haven t call microsoft and i m sure they d be happy to send you some ,2

 hi it s an easy question for you windows gurus i d appreciate any help we need to write an on line help for our application we don t have windows software developer s toolkit yet since we just want to build a hlp file around windows help engine i hope it won t be that complicated anyway could someone kindly give me some hints of how to build such an on line help if it does not take pages to explain or if it is complicated would you help to point out what i would need to do it vincent q yin umyin ccu umanitoba ca hi if you have developed your own windows application you must have a sdk of some sort that contains the hc exe or hc exe file to compile and generate hlp files out of rtf files no u can download what zip from ftp cica indiana edu this package from ms is all u need to buid simple hlp files from rich text format files rtf this package also contains dot tamplates for ms word win rtf files are generated by a wordprocessor like word for dos or w w if this is not the solution be more specific about your application ,2
 i think you can do this with regedit which can make changes to the ole registration database from program manager or file manager choose run and type regedit you do have it its included with windows but not well documented ,2
the latest driver release is and can be found at ftp cica indiana edu in the pub pc win directory structure as pro zip i checked with ati s bbs last nite and there were no releases past we have the ati local bus card and i noticed that i get garbage around the edges of a window when i move it has anybody else noticed this also tom thomas b fisk internet fisk mayo edu mayo clinic if you don t know where voice first street sw you re going you ll never fax mail stop d stm get there rochester mn ,2
 just a thought on resources it is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources i have used glockenspeil commonview under motif and os i wrote a resource converter from os to motif but it really wasn t too easy especially the naming scheme in motif you cannot rename controls widgets with windows you can call the ok button id ok in every instance this doesn t work for motif you d have to call it dialog ok and motif expects a text string rather than a number so your constructor should know how to convert a define into the proper resource identifier i d check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to by the way i would never use commonview or glockenspiel for anything alex ,2
 i had the same problem at first i thought it was the video driver and made sure i had the most current drivers because the problem was most evident at svga resolution modes it didn t help and after a bit of experimentation determined that the problem existed in standard vga resolution mode it was just much less noticeable my mouse was an older ms serial version i bought second hand in it worked just fine in dos and dos based graphic applications on the guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse i borrowed a new mouse a ms bus model and tried it that solved the problem so if your mouse is old you may want to try replacing it for a newer one signoff,2

 i have used both version drivers for win and the new drivers i have had none of these problems no gpf s at all i have a feeling that your problems are not with the card or drivers the ati ultra drivers are considered some of the most reliable on the market and the ss x ones seem quite good as well maybe you should check bios problems in your gateway i know a few people with gateway dx s and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility especially with graphics the only gpf s i have ever had can be directly attributable to using abusing applications i even got the newest drivers from diamond when people started complaining i still only have one small problem with them and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes reads to the swap file ,2

has anyone had problems with ami pro after running pctools v compress i have not corrupted data due to having caches other than pc cache running so that is not it the first time i try to run ami pro after loading windows it loads but causes i think it was a segmentation fault in amipro exe right before it finishes with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading and then causes a general protection fault in module amiproui dll at i have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling ami pro this has happened twice with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive btw i am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs and if you don t already know pctools compress is actually a defragger despite it s name my system is a mhz with mb of ram and a nec oem hard drive etc but that shouldn t make a difference please email me as i can t keep up with the newsgroup and it will cut down on net traffic anyways thanks derek,2
recently the following problem has arrisen the first time i turn on my computer when windows starts from my autoexec after the win title screen the computer reboots on its own usually the second time after reboot or from the dos prompt everything works fine s far as i remember i have not changed my config sys or autoxec bat or win ini i can t remember whether this problem occured before i optimized defragmented my disk and created a larger swap file thank you mathcad system sx mb stacker win dos ,2
 gawd i love windows you ll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired you re not stupid smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment a reasonably accurate prediction here s a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of x cards the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number it also holds some other information that s not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area x cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each in your case one cluster is bytes as a cluster is filled another is allocated to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says it s the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it doesn t have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it fixes now let s do a bit of a post mortem all of these files have sizes according to the fat which don t match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size in other words the directory entry for cvpic exe may say the file is bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of clusters attached to it my numbers obviously are made up disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files file chk through file chk and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong it s interesting to note that c spart par is your windows swap file to fix this you should copy each cross linked file to a new name this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the cross linked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon vpnet chi il us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec rd ,2
 they are working ok but your definitions in qvtnet ini and qvthost rc are incorrect see below no i don t think so you are using qvtnet and novell concurrently aren t you they use different packet types so qvtnet tcp ip and novell ipx spx should be able to coexist just fine pktmux is required if you are using different tcp ip packages concurrently there is the first problem you didn t specify hostnames just ip addresses your file should look like this name of your nameserver name of your router here you should only specify your hostname without the domain part instead use router name of your router as specified in your qvthost rc i know the release notes for say that ip addresses should work also but apparently they don t here too you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the ip address it worked fine for me that way although i could not specify more than one nameserver the relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers separated by commas but it didn t work hope it helps richard ,2

our student association runs a small novell network which has a subnetwork of windows for workgroups and microsoft mail the director of finance en electrical engineering student would like to gateway this system either via slip or not into the university s network and thus the internet at the very least to exchange e mail but possibly also to do ftp s etc for now this would be done via a bps modem he would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check mail but would otherwise connect whenever needed what is the best way to do this gatewaying software is available but what works best please reply to me dkmiller unixg ubc ca or the d of f dleung ee ubc ca with a cc to the other i don t read all of these groups regularly so mail is best if this is a common question please pot me to a faq or ftp site ,2

i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable my problem is that on some of our machines running ms dos and windows in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error i have raised the amount of environment space to bytes using the shell command in config sys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out if i just click on the ms dos icon i can create a bunch of environment varibles from the dos shell the problem is that on some machines setting the value of an environment variable in a bat file fails has anyone seen such behavior before i see no place in the pif fail to configure environment space ,2

 i have had several problems with the card applications crashed when moving the mouse vga mode fixed by removing the line stacks from config sys the default value stacks does just fine random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse in a color graphical mode the hardware cursor modes fixed by turning off the hardware scroll xmode scrolloff before entering the graphics mode this also fixed the problem of the windowed dos boxes under windows with the hardware scroll enabled applications write garbage outside the window the screensavers do not remove the cursor in color modes hardware cursor i don t know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions a remove for draw which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove unconditionally do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem the vesa driver does not support the x x m truecolor mode universal vesa drivers do not run at all ,2

 again not true the characters in a tt or type font depend on the maker if someone converts a type font to tt they ll only get the characters in the font of orgin tt allows for much more flexibility in this area as well you can have thousands of glyphs in a tt font file mac ps windows unicode char set and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on well yes both type and truetype fonts can contain lots of characters and in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to windows ansi in windows and to mac standard roman encoding on the mac no difference there between t and tt and as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing reason is that a font with characters is very large and if you can only access of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage and at the moment there is only one program of that uses partial font downloading for instance all or our fontpack tt fonts have the mac windows char set in them the metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set yes and t text fonts all have the iso adobe character set which is a superset of windows ansi and macintosh standard roman enocding the question is whether you can get at the glyphs in windows for example you cannot get at the ligatures fi anfd fl both t and tt even though a font may very well have them and while it is somewhat painful to reencode a type font and to create a new windows metric file pfm for it there are utilities out there to allow you do this how do i reencode a truetype font how can i get at the fi and fl ligatures in windows or on the mac are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard wired windows ansi encoding regards a east harmony road bob niland suite internet rjn csn org fort collins co compuserve ,2
 there are alternatives you can try to write a small c program something like int my int var my int var system command and display my int var value which is the exit code of the command or use dos com instead of command com it has built in move command you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function of dos c echo exec command will display the exit code of the command get dos not worth buying if you already have qemm pctools norton and you only need the move utility ,2

hi i m having a problem with truetype fonts in windows i have installed the cyrillic fonts i found on cica and now a strange thing happens sometimes windows uses cyrillic when its supposed to use times roman examples the pc tools backup version has one line of cyrillic text in its opening banner the next to last line importing a word for windows text written in times into wp also results in cyrillic does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem thanks,2
 i think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit as far as the disk is concerned you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space the limit that causes the message windows will only use is the amount of virtual address space that the virtual memory manager will create and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when windows starts in the enh section of system ini you can specify a parameter pageovercommit multiplier the following description is from the windows resource kit this entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of linear address space the vmm will create for the system which is computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to the nearest mb and then multiplying that value by the value specified for pageovercommit increasing this value increases the amount of available linear address space causing the size of data structures to increase this also increases paging activity proportionately and can slow down the system you can specify a value between and the default is to change this entry you must edit system ini ,2
hi i recently bought an orchid fahrenheit it s a real nice card but i m having very big problems with it the basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows something like every other line or so also when i use a dos gif viewer namely vpic c in fahrenheit mode vertical lines are swapped it s very strange looking if it uses vesa standards however it works great only it thinks there s only k on the card there s mb on there i have contacted orchid support and they tried to be helpful but didn t have the answer i don t think the card is the problem since it works great on my friend s computer here is my setup fahrenheit mb bios opti chipset ami bios mb ram maxtor mb harddrive slave maxtor mb harddrive master panasonic c monitor version windows drivers windows i tried taking all memory managers etc off and took all other cards besides disk controller off my friend s setup is sx shamrock monitor if anyone has seen anything like this or can otherwise help i will be very greatful please send e mail to tdarugar tartarus ucsd edu or tdarugar ebon ucsd edu,2

i just got a copy of tobias managing your money v i have quicken and it s wonderful for some things but mym seems to have some features that q doesn t for example q doesn t seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account or is there something that i m not doing right and q can actually do that anyway mym seems to be able to handle monthly deductions in fact it can apparently do better than that that is you can specify monthly bimonthly quarterly even yearly anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions maybe someone who has used both or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review anything would be greatly appreciated if i keep mym i have to pay for it and i don t know whether it s worth doing if mym is better than q of course i will keep it but if q can do everything mym can do maybe even better i won t thanks all ,2

 there you go com and com use the same irq therefore you can t use a mouse on com and a modem on com or vice versa it s a limitation of dos and in fact windows will not see a mouse on anything other than com or com accept this fact and either get a bus mouse or get a new computer no the advice above applies ,2

while there are too many ps clones to count some of which are quite poor trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience three questions come to mid real quick for something like this q which version of adobe ps will we clone aside from the level and level issues adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modifications upgrades fixes just as all other software vendors do the level stuff may seem sound now but i assure you changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition this allows them to shift people to maintenance as well as design efforts for level q do we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly from the laserwriter to the laserjet there have been bugs if i had a number to call at hp or adobe they ld have heard from me deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate q do we follow the red book or do we follow someone s implementation without a doubt there are differences between the red book and adobe s ps with level many issues have been refined but the red book does leave big big holes in the implementation specific stuff it would be nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of adobe s ps don t do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions q pscript drv having done a lot of ps clone testing myself the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test files the primary source we use is genoa and having characterizes their ps ats files of them over half are taken from pscript drv it may not ideal but the ats files are what the printer vendors use i m sure that adobe uses them too but adobe s output is by definition correct even if its wrong yes there are some very poor clones we ve seen them here at rastek a sub of genicom which has its own clone called geniscript some are poor for lack of design some are poor because they followed the red book and some are poor because the vendors don t know what ps is ,2

i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few questions about windows for workgroups i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver i am considering moving all our machines to w wg q how much conventional ram does w wg use over and above the driver for the network card q if i have a novell ne card are the lsl and ipx drivers still needed q does w wg do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of w wg note i do not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy of w wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies q if you buy the upgrade to windows for w wg does it replace all of win as you install it or does it depend on current win files q if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out will i have any troubles with the w wg machines when i started this message i was going to ask only questions but i got carried away i ll stop now i look forward to your replies al ,2
 and why they are considering using winbench as a test they may want to read everything steve gibson has said on the subject in his infoworld column the past couple of month in short virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the winbench suite so the winbench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks in the last pc magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators and admitted that many of them cheated on winbench interestingly they allowed one type of cheating behaviour caching for bitblt operations no matter how unreal yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used at least one card was eliminated from the editor s choice because of cheating on the benchmark ,2

 when i first setup windows using the self load mode it grabbed about megs of swap file space my meg hd was nearly empty at that time i deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded now my hd is nearly full and windows just took megs i have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your permanent swap file the same size as your regular ram size i have megs of ram and windows took meg perm swap file works very well in fact with my available hd space about megs it won t let me make the swap file any bigger you should change your virtual mem swap file to megs i think that is what you said your ram was c ya artin,2
to those interested in the new ati ultra cards i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems b i m pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesn t work in systems with over m ram there is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesn t work i posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didn t have this problem c false d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over m by using their configuration software no messing with jumpers necessary the m problem is probably valid only for isa cards a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than m ram eisa and vlb or m isa m should not be a problem for you b dunno c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus a nope i can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all non interlaced b yes according to pc magazine they ve tested a local bus version that does x in bit which may or may not be interlaced c not for the pro sometimes for the plus some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to do with bits only with screen size note that for bit color and windows you must have megs memory size calculations notwithstanding a they aren t perfect but are much improved i don t recall the last time which i had to leave mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due to software incompatibility b true many people recommended going back to build or c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad do not print correctly though they do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have bugs d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory i am running the color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver a it s quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate b yes i ll admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what i wanted to use it for too bad it crashed in many different ways every minutes or so c depends on many many things a i like it b well pc magazine seems to think it is c yes this appears to be true d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it better cards are coming out who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was developing at that time pc magazine about two months or so back overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i don t have an graphics ultra yet ati graphics ultra plus accelerated x at k colours true colour m at x multimedia video acceleration for indeo video rle and video compressed stretch full motion video windows to full size fast vga includes button mouse isa versions only anti aliased fonts ed avail in colour mode only i think real time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop around a length card size priced from u s ati graphics ultra pro everything in graphics ultra plus faster performance with vrams accelerated x at colours hz non interlaced available in isa eisa and microchannel priced from u s ati technologies i hope this summary can be of use to you al p s i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few years which i generally liked ,2
hi all i m asking for info on behalf of a friend is there what would be the best way to copy the output of a monitor on to video tape any ideas please prescribe additional hardware and or software i m just assuming an intel windows environment thanks in advance jerry,2
 i bought a viewsonic for use at home but after a week i took it back i felt for the money my nec fg that i use at work was a much better monitor the nec is sharper flatter less distorted and more stable i have heard complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not match up i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that the nec did not i personally like the non etched nec with the ocli filter and the tube on the was not as nice the had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems also it would change brightness when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the controls and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill on the postive side although not as handsome as the nec the had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model is being sold through oem channels with a panasonic label on it if it s available that way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it for now the nec has my vote but i m searching for one of the new cheaper nec fge s to see if it s just as good as its older brother the fg before i decide which one to buy i have no experience with the nanao i can never keep the nanao models straight and don t have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of all models standard employer disclaimers apply ,2

ok i ve heard rumors about this i might have even seen it in a few places and i d like some info is it possible to embed fonts in a document like write word or ami pro so the file can be printed on another machine that doesn t have the font if possible how is it done i m sorry if this is a faq i couldn t find a faq list i would also apreciate knowing where that is if a windows faq exsists thanks in advance ,2
that s me ok i realize i have to get the font files from some ftp site i found them at cica but i now have another question are the zip fonts compatible with gswin ,2
thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows i found shareware workspace managers from australia s ms windows archive monu cc monash edu au which mirrors some sites in the u s the three i found were workspaces wspace zip this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found it is very easy to use it displays a small window containing buttons plus an extra button for configuration purposes one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away also it would have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons maybe some user specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package workshift wrksft zip while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces lacked it was quite time consuming to set things up with workspaces all but the first workspace is initially empty with workshift you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like i e what applications they contain also the main window is quite large but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace with workspaces there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it workshift provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful bigdesk and backmenu backdesk zip this is an interesting package which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager other goodies include backmenu which provides a pop up root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in x windows the menu is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus which is provides quite handy access to applications you could say it is a menu based alternative to the program manager also bundled in backdesk zip is a program called wrun which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow up of a particular section ,2
i am running windows windows for work groups and just loaded dos what s happening appears as a graphics problem with file manager i ve added some menubar buttons but there appears to be a gray boxed region that covers the top rds of the button row these buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus the pulldown menus look fine and the disk label region looks fine but you only see the bottom few pixels of the task buttons anyone else experience this thanks ,2
whenever i start file manager the status bar is not displayed even though it is selected in the options menu if i deselect it then select it again the bar appears anyone have any ideas why this is happening thanks,2
 i have a dx computer with a soundblaster card i m running microsoft windows v i have the sb driver set up properly to play normal sounds wav files etc i want to play midi files through the media player that is included with windows i know i have to set up the patch maps or something in the midi mapper in the control panel i know nothing about midi this is to be the way i ll get my feet wet how do i set up windows so that i can play midi files if you install the soundblaster windows drivers correctly and have the latest drivers the media player should be setup to play files authored to microsoft s multimedia midi authoring standard general midi see the section in the back of the voyetra manual in the soundblaster midi upgrade kit you ll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different mappings so don t expect them to always sound correct without using some kind of midi file editor such as voyetra s sequencer plus ,2
i have just noticed my filemanager doing something strange recently usually the line at the bottom of the filemanager the status bar i guess displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection if i select a whole bunch of files i will get an exact byte count recently i notice it incorrectly displays this count it s truncating if i select a file that is say bytes it correctly displays bytes if i select select a file that is bytes it displays bytes not kbytes just bytes if i select it will report only bytes in the selection if i select over a meg worth of files say it reports bytes it s as if it s got a problem with displaying more than characters my system dx m memory stacker dos win i ve run the latest virus scanners scan f prot and they didn t report anything could i have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting of the status bar in the filemanger nicholas masika masika bnr ca bell northern research ottawa fax opc development operations,2

 i have normal procomm plus for dos but i ve been considering buying the windows version it got really great reviews in computer shopper i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modem he has a modem on a mhz machine i can t see it having trouble keeping up his pcplus for dos works great re what to do after the high speed modem arrives edition apr this article applies only to windows and and not to nt os or dos apps not running under windows one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs c serial com performance is seriously deficient almost everyone who purchases a high speed modem v bis v pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrading the modem overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old bps modem there are three reasons for the problem the universal asynchronous receiver transmitters uarts used in most pcs are primitive ns devices with single byte fifo buffers if the operating system driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost dos being a fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows can t windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupts often take longer to service overruns are much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pc modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you ll get no useful advice at all most of the store front and mail order sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term and many didn t even know what a uart was even your pc has ns a uarts and ps s do or if you can upgrade your mother com board or add a new com board you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers don t take full advantage of the windows is improved in this regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrade applications like procomm win which is what i use cannot get around this problem by themselves if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldn t want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem cards don t even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msd exe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be the hardware situation the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns or ns chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you can t replace them you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windows msd exe be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a if you run it from a windows dos prompt the ns uart has separate byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to bps although with current modem technology there s no point in pushing your luck by going over bps the has shorted access cycle times than the or the also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on your mother board multi function i o card com board or isa mca modem card if you can t find a socketed component with the numbers or your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you won t be able to perform a chip replacement if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have one or more socketed or chips you can buy plug in ns afn or pc c cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for to each the n chip is the normal pin dual in line package other styles are available but avoid any ns chips without the a the c c are presumably all ok early ns chips have bugs although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips national semiconductor a chips technology c texas instruments t c a silicon systems m vlsi c turbocom warns about the pre a ns and western digital c says that problems have been reported with early ibm ps sx and systems ibm reportedly will upgrade them if you don t have socketed chips you ll need to buy an after market com or multi function board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multi function card you ll need to either disable the com port s you are replacing or re assign them to com although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly i elected buy the modular circuit technology mct aio card from jdr microdevices samaritan drive san jose ca voice us voice other fax us the mct aio and the is important sells for it is an bit isa card providing port type connector address and irq comments com db m com irq ns afn in socket com ribbon com irq ns afn in socket parallel db f lpt irq game ribbon the kit includes a ribbon cable and db f connector for the secondary com port a ribbon cable connector for the game port two bulkhead plates for the ribbon based connectors and a f to f adaptor cable each port can be individually disabled and the com ports have tx rx rts cts dtr dcd and dsr jumpers jdr also sells a super i o m f card that also has ide i have heard from several people about less expensive m f i o cards with s tsd systems for the card plus per greenfield trading and distributors voice fax their card is w one w and they sell afns for r s data systems inc east highway longwood fl phone fax com lpt game card w s for i have no personal experience with any of the firms except jdr meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my built in vlsi based ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com and using irq sharing the software situation simply upgrading to uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems the standard ms serial drivers don t take full advantage of the the windows drivers are even less capable and the windows drivers have the following limitations they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which results in an interrupt rate of x during uploads they set the trigger level at bytes too high it s easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to with a v bis modem sparse data and text can easily compress or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of bps would be effective the api won t accept rates above cbr the api won t let dos programs know there is a there and even if it did dos programs that aren t aware get little benefit from a port with the standard drivers they don t allow irq sharing for com the bios doesn t initialize com properly in many systems windows provides no workaround for apps that don t provide port speed options above bps these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after but before rumors suggest they may be solved in windows you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version from bio engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bbs mcimail compuserve price was around as i recall bio eng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check egghead and software list turbocom but as far as i know they don t stock it bio is not a software company per se they apparently needed reliable hi speed serial connections for an in house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows it is run time licensed i now have my host dte connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed bps i am also using bps when linking an hp lx to my pc with lossless bi directional i o uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers note that is still the highest rate that the windows port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes i also have cts rts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer bit ascii data xon xoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for xon xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xon xoff a well respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the s can t really do cts rts all by itself in the dos windows environment so using data rates above may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a co processed com board but this will cost you more than a turbocom upgrade a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems closing soapbox comments the state of rs c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry because it is the oldest standard i o interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system that family of machines was subsequently introduced with ports however this is the exception few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent i o you may as well learn what you can about serial i o because this situation shows no sign of improving soon when v fast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users world wide whose pcs sort of work today with v but will fail miserably with v fast without a hardware buffered uart like the and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a v fast modem will be a waste of money regards a east harmony road

software that comes together with the videoblaster is designed to work together with the soundblaster from the same manufacturer since i do not own a soundblaster is there a possibility to use the pc speaker driver to play audio files for the videoblaster avi audio video interleave files i think what i should have is a device driver for the media player that controls the pc speaker driver instead of the soundblaster card something like mcispkr drv has anybody heard of such a driver or am i on the wrong track any information on this appreciated please send e mail since i don t watch this group regularly ,2

greetings i ve had a bunch of problems with the x opening a dos window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows blowing up into a set of horizontal lines hashing the entire desktop nothing can recover this except to completely exit from windows the other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling as if a cr was printed without an lf this seems only to happen to communications programs but i can t nail it down any further than that note though that the comms programs don t have to be communicating even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows wpwin would sometimes blow up and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem i ve still seen this but only once or twice with wpwin ,2

i just installed a new truetype font under ms windows but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a laserjet non postscript printer when i use the font in coreldraw the document prints correctly so i assume coreldraw knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer but when i use the windows accessory write the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font yet write does display the font correctly on the screen i looked through all the windows and laserjet manuals but got nowhere all of them just make the statement that truetype fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen so i assume windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically but how to make it do that ,2
hey all i got an equation editor and since it didn t automagically appear in my object dialog box i e insert object equation i decided to manually place it there so i went into win ini is there another way to do this the embedding section and added equation equation equation path filename picture didn t work quit windows go back aha mistake correct it it looks fine start windows doesn t work play with it for a while at one point having two entries to see if one works and th other don t and finally i get it to work the only thing i can see that s different now is that it s now the first item on the list and it used to be the last but now i end up with three equation entried and all of them working and only one entry in win ini so does any netian know what s wrong or rather how to correct this i e make equation appear but once also all the entries in the embedding appear as above it s obvious that path filename is the executable or whatever and picture has something to do withthe way it appears picture description but what are the others i e in soundrec sound sound whate s the difference between the st sound and the nd and what is soundrec i don t think it s the name of the executable as other entries e g msworkschart aren t thanks i a mickey,2
 if you are interested in a program which is very easy to use i strongly suggest approach it is extremely easy to use make reports etc i own both it and paradox and i almost never use paradox if you need to build up a complicated application then paradox is the way to go i have heard horror stories about the access programming being extremely cryptic since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff work home use and you have not used a database before i recommend approach i have found only one small thing which i would like it to do more easily i have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering to permanently reorder to use the old dbase iii command the records requires sorting the records appropriately no problem since i almost always use them in this order exporting the database to another database which can still be an approach database and then copying the exported files back to the original filename this is a small weakness considering the other items i really like about approach it is also a little slower than paradox other than the loading paradox takes forever and a minute to load paradox also takes a lot of memory both hard disk around mb and ram ,2

 i believe you have the correct files i think what you ll have to do is go back into setup and choose change video adapter or whatever it is called then the trick is choose the same adaptor you currently have what setup does is it actually changes the file win com whenever you go into it and change the video hardware selection it incorporates the contents of vgalogo rle into win com when you do this this trick can also be used to change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be sig alert ,2
 be very careful with these results as i recall numbers from winbench are calculated differently from and so these figures are not comparable however to answer stephen s question replacing the ahead b card with a diamond x will yield a cost effective dramatic speed increase for windows that or the ati graphics ultra plus ,2

i am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and i have a few question about microsoft s office pack i was wondering are the programs that are packaged with the office pack winword power point excel and ccmail complete and the latest addition are the programs hobbled in any way can we update single programs at a latter date i e from excel to excel do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation is there anything that i should be aware of that makes the office package less of deal that it seems sorry if i seem skeptical put the price for the office package on the street sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first computer and software but all four complete programs for less than makes me just a little suspicious maybe its just me thanks for your help in advance kirt wilson northwestern university ,2

 you can change it as part of a continuously downsizing government organization my code branch changes about once a year i just finished changing the registration information using norton utilities i sent the original requester the hex offset into user exe containing the information and his reply indicated he got several similar answers and it s not encoded in any way as for the legality there s nothing that keeps me from changing the information it certainly doesn t reach out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual ,2

i am looking for some bar code fonts especially code of did anybody know any ftp sites or bbs that i can download these types of fonts please email to me if you have any info thanks ,2
 you could use dos to do this partly you can set up different config sys and autoexec bat commands for each user and they just have to select their menu option on bootup then you can have the autoexec bat copy the win ini and system ini files and change directories for them when they exit windows it can copy back generic ini files if you want this is the only way i can think of there may be some programs somewhere that allow you to do this better though using dos allows each person to have a custom config sys and autoexec bat ,2
 but a disk compare utility old versus new will and windows is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying if you can spare the or so compressed megs no we re not but we re also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience i don t like dealing with floppies personally i have no use for changing the registration info but i see it as a valid need and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half hour reinstall that s just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another so while i m not going to put much time into it myself here s the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information copy all your windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it i ve been using c winstall myself from there copy that directory to something like c winorig install from c winstall comp the two directories to determine changes i e comp winorig report txt look in the report file for the file s that change assuming they didn t cover themselves covering their own tracks at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset locate said offset in the original directory and see what s there using a hex editor and do the same for the modified one you re on your own as far as breaking the code goes i don t really do cryptography it s probably just an xor key or something i think ms is more concerned with joe schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with real pirates who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway this technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies lotus stuff is probably like that as i noted before if you can afford the space on the hard disk and don t do much in the way of customization reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous doing some of the stuff i ve mentioned here may well void your license with microsoft as if they d ever find out if you aren t careful with the disk editor you could also mung something important duh i guess that s a disclaimer have at it rob,2

 i don t believe irq is the problem i tried a mouse on com irq the usual place and it still did not like it simply windows seems to only support mice on com or com the funny part is though that microsoft s own mouse driver xx was quite happy with my mouse sitting on com why can t windows use the mouse driver or at least support com i ve tried this too actually i wanted to be able to use my second modem com irq from windows it still will not talk to that modem i created two profiles amstrad for my amstrad modem on com irq and maestro for my maestro on com irq it will not talk to the maestro at all nor here windows i ve seen nothing like that i ve experimented with logitech s mouse driver too with no sucess if you have a soundblaster pro it should support irq as well finally a board that supports irqs the only one i have except my ide controller hamish ,2

 i believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on ftp cica indiana edu in pub pc win nt called something like nwnt zip there is an index ascii file there which lists the programs in that directory and what they do unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp ip over your primary nic so if you really want to run it get yourself an extra nic and bind it to that otherwise wait for next release like i am ,2

 all right not saying i know any more than the average salesguy i ll give your question a shot the key issue that i bought my bj on was ink drying speed you really have to try awful hard to get the bj ink to smear the hp deskjets need seconds to completely dry in both cases however do not get your pages wet unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not toner but that should go without saying my pc has very little memory only meg ram so the bj takes a little while to print but every application i use takes a while to run once the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out every seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are the bj can do windows soft fonts i m assuming that the deskjet can or hp wouldn t sell many size is another factor the bj is much smaller but the hp is built like a tank i bet the bj would get damaged first finally the print quality i love the bj s resolution it looks like a good laser quality print the hp s i ve used they look like ink not as impressive ,2

salutations i don t usually subscribe to these newsgroups so i would really appreciate it if someone could possibly e mail me the answer to my problem i have been using windows since buying it last winter but i have just now come across an annoying bug i now have about different groups in program manager but it seems that everytime i install something new that makes a new group it promptly disappears after i turn of windows this happened when i installed excel and winfax pro v they both created their own groups but when i turned off windows and reran them they were gone i had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as i turn off windows my set up precision dx w megs trident c with meg windows running in x colour mode logitech mouseman thank you in advance emile woo ewoo unixg ubc ca ,2
 it also runs os character based apps and posix apps the dos bit and bit windows apps run in a windows bit subsystem if you consider the fact that nt has the lanman redirectors built in support for tcp ip built in support for netbeui comes with tcp utils like ping and an ftp client etc applications like schedule and a bit version of msmail the storage argument isnt an issue i ran it on a with mram and it did a ton of disk swapping with a m virtual memory paging file it functioned but it crawled this was the oct build i upgraded the machine to m and the performance is good at that point i installed the march build consider they are probably still working on the feature set and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code yet i have little info on chicago so i cant make a comparison is it in beta is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison just my ,2

hello i thought this problem might have something to do with windows smartdrv and a vesa video card any ideas i recently purchased a dx machine and am having problems where the machine will suddenly freeze or reboot this may happen in windows or dos sometimes it is after printing a document sometimes after using the mouse and sometimes just when i am sitting there twice when it happened the machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps i looked in the documentation and the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts the machine has the following configuration and files dx ami bios and floppies meg ide hard drive k cache microsoft compatible mouse on com citizen gsx on lpt ni supervga monitor with vesa windows accelerator card w meg two vesa slots windows dos config sys device c windows himem sys dos high devicehigh c dos setver exe files buffers stacks autoexec bat echo off lh c windows smartdrv exe prompt p g path c dos c windows c mouse lh c mouse mouse set temp c dos lh c dos doskey when the machine freezes i can t use the mouse or keyboard or use ctrl alt del to reboot if any one can give me any help i would greatly appreciate it if anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency memory wise i would appreciate that also douglas b dodson internet dbd icf hrb com hrb systems inc state college pa usa ,2
 as a followup this is a co worker s machine he has the latest drivers it only happens using the x x driver sometimes it takes a minute or so for the cursor to wig out but it eventually does in this mode i susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants i excluded a c ff in the emm line and in system ini the problem persisted perhaps it is something specific to the gateway machine or it s components it is a mhz dx eisa bus with an ultrastore xx controller ah well i was hoping this was some kind of known problem or somebody had seen it before perhaps a call to gateway is in order but i do find folks here usually are far more in the know ,2

 i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using procomm plus for windows but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modem he has a modem on a mhz machine tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card my baud modem was one of the reasons i sought out the diamond speedstar x i get about million winmarks on my and it just about keeps up with the modem speed using procomm plus for windows too he should get over million on his machine with the same card anything should yield acceptable speed i m using pc plus at home on my trusty old nec sx with a baud modem with no problems at all i am however running only straight color vga ,2

word c doesn t show the period centred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless i believe the character used by w w is the period centred this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w w altering the paragraph or cedilla does alter their font graphics displayed however is the w w character used to indicate spaces the period centred character has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf ,2
ok i have a dx isa w diamond stealth vram mb i was really satisfied w its performance in windows but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos vga especially this new strike commander this stealth vram can only give me fps i use dbench my winmark was million i think so right now i m considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully can perform approx same w my current vram in windows and also can perform dos vga preferably fps i also saw the dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that speedstar x and orchid prodesigner d s ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard both can give fps in dos vga w dx does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type which one is the worthiest not necessarily fastest any other card recommendation is welcomed too also if possible where can i get this card for the cheapest thanks in advance folks ,2
 i tried to respond by email but all attempts bounced the condition of the ctrl key before you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever you have to be holding the ctrl key when you release the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation here s a simple experiment select a file and begin to drag it no ctrl key notice that the file s icon disappears from the listing window now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the ctrl key keeping the mouse button pressed all the while in addition the icon that you are dragging will show a while you are holding the ctrl key indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved ,2

 article crossposted from comp os ms windows apps author was dr richard timmer posted on apr gmt hello winnetters i have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of ms access and borland paradox win however are there any users out there with experience with the database package called approach it has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than paradox i have ruled out access because some aspects of it are extremely non intuitive e g requiring a field to always have a value i like what i ve seen of paradox but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what i have mhz mb ram so please provide me with your thoughts are approach good and bad thanks ,2

 don t be so sure look what happened to japanese citizens in the us during world war ii if you re prepared to say let s round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial it s only a short step to gassing them without trial after all it seems that the nazis originally only intended to imprison the jews the final solution was dreamt up partly because they couldn t afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by goering s total war those who weren t gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease ,0

 deletions first of all infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans to explain certain things in a certain way we don t know if it actually applies to reality we don t know if anything in the world is infinite you don t know if the universe is actually continuous continuum is another mathematical concept based on infinity used to explain things in a certain way i have a pretty good idea of what infinity is it s a man made concept and like many man made concepts it has evolved through time ancient greeks had a different understanding of it precicely we don t even know if infinity applies to reality ,0
 d d i just thought of another one in the bible so it s definately not because of lack of religion the book of esther which i read the other day for other reasons describes the origin of pur im a jewish celbration of joy and peace the long and short of the story is that people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about you couldn t swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice peaceful solution course joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind i agree with bobby this far religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for that doesn t reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the universe the very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache contentsthan in any absolute truth and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders the point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war whether these things are a part of religion an unpleasant side effect or as bobby would have it the result of people switching between religion and atheism spontaneously the results are the same religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of man s history atheists on the other hand preen preen are typically not an ideological social caste nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs the overuse of nazism and stalinism just show how true this is two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means anyone who cannot see the obvious namely that these were groups founded for reasons entirely their own who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull is trying too hard basically bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were not specifically fought over religion that he does not have many choices well i m off to key west where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butter dishes ciao,0
 yes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws however i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law sunni and jaffari can be levelled against muslim or non muslims both within and outside dar al islam i do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to islam falls into this category of the law i do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty my understanding is that khomeini s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the qur an hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book however the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights it was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media ,0

 issued by khomeini it shouldn t be relevant to anyone but issued by an honest and learned scholar of islam it would be relevant to any muslim as it would be contrary to islamic law which all muslims are required to respect anyone sufficiently well versed in islamic law and capable of reasoning if you are talking about a weak sense of excuse it depends on what sense of excuse you have in mind only someone who thinks my opinion is important obviously obviously you don t care nor do i care that you don t care ,0

 wait a minute doug i know you are better informed than that the us has never invaded nicaragua as far as i know we liberated grenada from the cubans to protect us citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip panama we invaded true twice this century vietnam we were invited in by the government of s vietnam i guess we invaded saudi arabia during the gulf war eh mexico we have invaded mexico or times once this century but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time hawaii we liberated it from spain so if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someone s border you are right out of but normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation if some nation invades the u s virgin islands would they be invading the virgin islands or the u s so from this point of view your score falls to out of mexico panama no it s someone who believes in peace at all costs in other words a person who would have supported giving hitler not only austria and czechoslakia but poland too if it could have averted the war and one who would allow hitler to wipe all all jews slavs and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik you ask well it depends on what your values are if you value life over liberty peace over freedom then i guess not but if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself if you d rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant s heel then yes it s bad to be a peace nik the problem with most peace niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable i would not have any argument or problem with a peace nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with the national defense but no they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point of view they militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace what rank hypocrisy all to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up and defend our freedoms against tyrants and who realize that to do so requires a strong national defense time to get off the soapbox now regards ,0
 i think this is a big leap sex depression one example is myself where no sex depression but seriously promiscuity is on a decline depression is not and it might be more reasonable to say depression promiscuity i think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems relationships family job friends and promiscuity is used as an escape since i see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond i don t see a problem with sex before not outside of marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple of course this is just my opinion ,0
 i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part about the jews sightseeing for years thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing palestinians in retrospect i can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many i originally saw it just as poetic license but it s understandable that others might see it differently i still think that ken came on a bit strong though i also think that your advice to masud khan before you argue with someone like mr arromdee it s a good idea to do a little homework or at least think was unnecessary throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti semitism if i agreed with that then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant but i think you re reading a lot into one flip sentence while probably not true in this case too often the charge of anti semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of israel anyway i d rather be somewhere else so i m outta this thread ,0
 the argument goes as follows q oid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be fine so what s that supposed to say am i missing something that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak ,0

 deletion you have given that example it is not lenient end of argument and chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either it rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system without checking if they suit the description and wasn t the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according to islamic law no i even believe what i don t like can you give better answers than that have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims a fact if memory serves and most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the orient and in islam as usually you miss the point aids is neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex futher the point is a very important point the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of aids it is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex the consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of aids please note that the idea that everybody would end up with aids when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual ,0

 no you don t understand i said that i don t think people can discuss the subjective merits of religion objectively this should be obvious people here have said that everyone would be better off without religion but this almost certainly isn t true but guns and axes are tools both of which have been used for murder should both be taken away that is to say i don t think motto misuse warrants its removal at least not in this case ,0
 actually the story goes that lucifer refused to bow before man as god commanded him to lucifer was devoted to god oh yeah there is nothing in genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake well a talking one had legs at the time too i don t think pointing out contradictions in stories is the best way to show the error in theology if they think a supernatural entity kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a fruit that gave them special powers well they might not respond well to reason and logic ,0
 sure it isn t mutually exclusive but it lends weight to i e increases notional running estimates of the posterior probability of the atheist s pitch in the partition and thus necessarily reduces the same quantity in the theist s pitch this is because the divine component falls prey to ockham s razor the phenomenon being satisfactorily explained without it and there being no independent evidence of any such component more detail in the next post occam s razor is not a law of nature it is way of analyzing an argument even so it interesting how often it s cited here and to what end it seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being primitive simple minded and unscientific anti intellectual and childish and yet again condemned as being too complex occam s razor the scientific explanation of things being much more straightforeward and apparently simpler which is it to be which is the non essential and how do you know considering that even scientists don t fully comprehend science due to its complexity and diversity maybe william of occam has performed a lobotomy kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away this is all very confusing i m sure one of you will straighten me out tough ,0

stuff deleted all five schools of law to the best of my knowledge support the death sentence for apostasy when it is accompanied by open persistent and aggravated hostility to islam otherwise i agree there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief the qur an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience public or private disavowal of islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable even by death but historically they are the exception cursing and insulting the prophets falls under the category of shatim ,0

archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition an argument consists of three stages first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premises of the argument they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises if something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted there are various forms of valid inference the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll come to those later another example god created you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form a because b if we re interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument if we re trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false if the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a b f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfalls are known as fallacies in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communists and murderers sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing you re white this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle examples of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles therefore no such flood occurred in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please don t find me guilty i m suffering enough through being an orphan argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example pornography must be banned it is violence against women the bible must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example christians generally dislike atheists you are a christian so you must dislike atheists this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases for example jim bakker was an insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause for example i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument for example homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tells us so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized for example consider we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items for example a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exists in two varieties the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts for example you are studying at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item for example ants can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare therefore we cannot legalize marijuana a is based on b fallacies is a type of fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar examples isn t history based upon faith if so then isn t the bible also a form of history islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isn t islam a form of christianity cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it for instance you re just being randomly abusive so you ve been abusive too ,0
 please enlighten me how is omnipotence contradictory by definition all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules of nature thus god cannot break them anything that god does must be allowed in the rules somewhere therefore omnipotence cannot exist it contradicts the rules of nature obviously an omnipotent god can change the rules when you say by definition what exactly is being defined certainly not omnipotence you seem to be saying that the rules of nature are pre existant somehow that they not only define nature but actually cause it if that s what you mean i d like to hear your further thoughts on the question ,0
 and you know why this is because you ve conveniently defined a theist as someone who can do no wrong and you ve defined people who do wrong as atheists the above statement is circular not to mention bigoting and as such has no value ,0

 i agree i reckon it s television and the increase in fundamentalism you think its the increase in pre marital sex others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets others think it s the increase in designer drugs others think it s a communist plot basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society are far too complicated for us to control we just have to hold on to the panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing but one things for sure depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage jeff ,0
 what i ve been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior that is it doesn t take much work to be moral but it certainly does to be immoral in some cases also i ve said that morality is a remnant of evolution our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in the animal kingdom but this doesn t get us anywhere your particular beliefs are irrelevant unless you can share them or discuss them ,0

 sure yes i did you see i don t think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly you being so interested in leniency for leniency s sake apparently think that people should simply be told the did a bad thing misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible i suspect that it s pretty unlikely that given my requirement of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very likely really care to give chapter and verse we could discuss it again not all of the orient follows the qur an so you ll have to do better than that sorry you haven t put out enough this is an argument for why you don t like religions that suppress sex a such it s an irrelevant argument if you d like to generalize it to an objective statement then fine my response is then you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments the urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it if the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner ,0
 in article vice ico tek com bobbe vice ico tek com robert someone spank me if i m wrong but didn t lord liar or lunatic originate with c s lewis who s this campollo fellow anyway i do think so and isn t there a clear connection with the i do believe because it is absurd notion by one of the original christians origen there is a similar statement attributed to anselm i believe so that i may understand in both cases reason is somewhat less exalted than anyone posting here could accept which means that neither statement can be properly analysed in this venue ,0
 well i ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road again the blame is on society yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution and every member of society shares this blame and most people s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can t always determine the difference in our flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not but what we know has no effect on an objective system why are you so sure why is your reality important but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack i don t think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice ,0
 this is becoming a tiresome statement coming from you it is a definition not an assertion islam is good belief in islam is good therefore being a believer in islam can produce only good because islam is good blah blah blah that s about as circular as it gets and equally meaningless to say that something produces only good because it is only good that it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition and all you re application is saying that it s true if you really believe it s true that s silly conversely you say off handedly that anything can happen under atheism again just an offshoot of believe it and it becomes true don t believe it and it doesn t like other religions i m aquainted with islam teaches exclusion and caste and suggests harsh penalties for behaviors that have no logical call for punishment certain limits on speech and sex for example to me this is not good i see much pain and suffering without any justification except for the waving of the hand of some inaccessible god by the by you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly for what is a knowledgeable believer except a contradiction of terms i infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith and if you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing to do with it does it ,0
 i assume that you are talking about the appeals processes etc well it should be noted that people who are imprisoned for life will also tend to appeal though not quite as much in the final hours anyway economics is not a very good reason to either favor or oppose the punishment ,0
 ah but what exactly is inherently abhorrent and why is it so what you re saying is in effect i think some things are repulsive and i know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me so they should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever period which in and of itself is nice enough to some extent i agree with you but i do not agree that things are inherently or absolutely immoral they are labeled immoral each for its own good reason and if the reason can even theoretically change then so can the label no it doesn t humans are to some extent similar because we all belong to the same species that that species has evolved is another story altogether to a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism of a flavour you re saying morality is what ll keep society alive and kicking it is i think up to a point but societies are not all alike and neither are their moralities similar identical no it s falsifiable through finding someoe who was created different whatever that might be in the real world ,0
 i assume you are posting to encourage comments how much history has tony campello read not much it seems it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about if only those christian scientists would take note in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics for example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people did tony follow that one up millions of people have died for a lie this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders the list is endless the aztecs lost btw that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point did tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of hitler was based i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane hmmm i don t think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in quoting the bible the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit tony s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless for example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct it i think if you posted this part to alt religion you would get more flames than here i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if i am pressed i could probably find the exact quotation ,0
 if you force me to do something am i morally responsible for it well make up your mind is it to be instinctive not to murder or not it s not even correct animals of the same species do kill one another sigh i wonder how many times we have been round this loop i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as primates have the beginnings of a moral sense since they seem to exhibit self awareness so what are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not is this your natural morality are you blind what do you think that this sentence means there must be the possibility that the organism it s not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives what would that imply i find the fact that they do to be significant ,0
 i have never been to wisconsin though i have been to neighbor minnesota being a child of the middle atlantic ny nj pa i found that there were few states in the provences that stood out in this youngster s mind california texas and florida to name the most obvious three however both minnesota and wisconsin stuck out solely on the basis of their politics both have always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states and my recent trip to minnestoa last summer served to support that state s reputation my guess is that wisconsin is probably the same at least that was the impression the people of minnesota left with me about their neighbors the only question in my head about wisconsin though is whether or not there is a cause effect relationship between cheese and serial killers ,0
 science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed interpretations of our observations perceptions values can also refer to meaning for example in computer science the value of is true and is false science is based on commonly agreed values interpretation of observations although science can result in a reinterpretation of these values the values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been fully agreed and the change with time the values of newtonian physic are certainly different to those of quantum mechanics ,0

 note that i never said that depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is due solely to extra marital sex i specifically said that it was a prime cause of this not the prime cause or the only cause of this i recognize that there are probably other factors too but i think that extra marital sex and subsequent destabilization of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in psychological problems including depression in the west in the th century ,0

i have a request for those who would like to see charley wingate respond to the charley challenges and judging from my e mail there appear to be quite a few of you it is clear that mr wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves between the last two re postings of the challenges i noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by mr wingate none of which answered a single challenge it seems unmistakable to me that mr wingate hopes that the questions will just go away and he is doing his level best to change the subject given that this seems a rather common net theist tactic i would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers in the following manner ignore any future articles by mr wingate that do not address the challenges until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so or if you must respond to one of his articles include within it something similar to the following please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges really i m not looking to humiliate anyone here i just want some honest answers you wouldn t think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout christian would you nevermind that was a rhetorical question ,0
 p p my favorite reply to the you are being too literal minded complaint is p that if the bible is really inspired by god and if it is really that p important to him then he would make damn certain all the translators and p scribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it right p literally if not then why should i put any merit at all in something p that has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it was p originally inspired by god p pthe corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak comparison of the pcurrent hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text phas in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia this pshouldn t be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner pare likely to makes some pains to make good copies ,0

 reference line trimmed yes well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species another example of a moral system is presented within the declaration of independence which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system that is we shall be moral unto what end well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system however i am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral i think that it is a very good approximation but we can t be perfect well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning ,0
 this posting is totally uncalled for in rec scouting the point has been raised and has been answered roger and i have clearly stated our support of the bsa position on the issue specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the scout oath specifically the promise to live morally straight there is really nothing else to discuss trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because it s like comparing apples to oranges i e people can t control their race but they can control their behavior what else is there to possibly discuss on rec scouting on this issue nobody including bsa is denying anybody the right to live and or worship as they please or don t please but it doesn t mean that bsa is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious and moral standards on which our society has been established and on which it should continue to be based ,0

some suspicions the nd psalm this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passages verse my god my god why have you forsaken me why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning oh my god i cry by day but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers indeed jesus doesn t do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me they make faces and wag their heads he committed his cause to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delights in him this seems to fit jesus s execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm many bulls encompass me they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encir cle me they have pierced my hands and feet i can see all my bones they divide my garments among them and cast lost for my raiment but you yhvh be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and i m sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation is yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion ka ari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to ka aru but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fits the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms this doesn t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms but then facts aren t bound by our religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesus s life and death how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims so far this has not said good things for st matthew the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesus s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about years after the fact tells us at jesus s execution jn but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these things took place that scripture be fulfilled the will look on him whom they ve pierced of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthew s attempts matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage john s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded reckoned with transgressors after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves mk and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his left and so the scripture was fulfilled which says he was reckoned with the transgressors here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event the servant is thought of as a criminal this also happens to fit the description of jesus had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him this is to be expected from a couple of robbers of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things luke tells us lk and one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed aren t you the messiah save yourself and us this certainly fits with mark s recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself and that the robbers did the same but then luke goes on but the other criminal rebuked the first saying don t you fear g d since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he said jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom and jesus answered verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now this little dialogue seems highly contrived it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn t seem likely to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke of course luke s recount also disagrees with mark s luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of g d do not have this avenue open this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen the end of the world mt now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about the disciples tell us when will this the temple s destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age jesus take care that no one leads you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the christ you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for this must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophets will arise and lead many astray but he who endures to the end will be saved this gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a testimony to the nations and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to the mountains immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his angels and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know that summer is near so also when you see all these things you will know that he is near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place but of the day and hour no one knows not the angels not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples he tells them that although he doesn t know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses it becomes abundantly clear from rev peter john and rev that jesus meant exactly what he said the end was very near for years christians have rationalised this th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether for years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon surely he must be all we must do is wait can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshua ben joseph died it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance then the saviour decided it wasn t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven so the story goes anyway as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters thus for years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted things may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold ,0

 why do babies get diseases etc here s the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimates is about billion years old and has had life for about billion of those years humans have only been around for at most about years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact disease ridden long before there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans deletions uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense i m really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease i m sure you ll agree but it still pops up from time to time even today and doesn t do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology i m an engineer not a doctor and died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty w age now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan who s making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases here s another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer s glue that is the original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletions my main point as i said was that there really isn t any evidence for the explanation you give at least that i m aware of but i couldn t help making a few nitpicks here and there sincerely ,0

 i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view as i ve articulated it above which may not be the true view of khomeini is from the basic principles of islam so that the non muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of islam such views are on the face of them and if they are not in contradiction with the basics of islam how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in islam while they are explicitly proscribed by the qur an in my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being is a heretical notion and one proscribed by islam absolutely i would be interested in discussing this privately and i am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the qur an however prima facie such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery explicitly proscribed by the qur an alaikum wassalam ,0
 size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size in this case i d say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area vietnam and korea might make good comparisons western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits i agree perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too but that s easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the s right back then it was all out war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i for one don t regret it sure and it s the people who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world s oil supply he had to be stopped sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade and once he did so a strong response from the west was required well it s not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i d have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest i mentioned it if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww that motivated the western alliance to war letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that what should i say about them anything in particular so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers if there had been black officers involved i m sure their would have been black jurors too this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow so it s hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument can we expect another revision soon just kidding i have to admit that i wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking so one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals ok it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law based on what the prosecution was asking for it s evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm the seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i m a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regards ,0

 are we talking about me or the majority of the people that support it anyway i think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in favor of the punishment if a murderer is going to be punished people that think that he should get what he deserves most people wouldn t think it would be fair for the murderer to live while his victim died perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic but your views are in the minority where are we required to have compassion forgiveness and sympathy if someone wrongs me i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him if someone kills another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn is not our entire moral system based on such a concept or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should never be violated this would sound like some sort of religious view once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant and you still have not answered my question if you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isn t this same concern shared with imprisonment shouldn t we by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person ,0

 this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism i e the belief that you can t deny anything that you can t prove doesn t exist this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them according to the above poster we must believe in objects or beings that haven t been proved not to exist so why stop at god there could be a huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond hair and they all live on other planets so we can t see them the reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god how did they shoot themselves in the foot there is a big difference here stalin didn t say that he stood for a particular moral position i e against murder and terrorism etc and then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least an honest killer this is not a support of stalin but an attack on this viewpoint saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the russians that helped stalin that weren t atheists don t they contradict your point besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists can t value life as much as theists which you didn t support ah and here s another point you didn t get out of the faq an atheist doesn t have to hold the positive view that god doesn t exist he she may just have the non existence of the positive belief here s the example strong atheism i believe god does not exist a positive belief weak atheism i don t believe in a god a negative belief these are not the same some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable or let s look at it this way in sets suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that i will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not so if s santa then e s no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa but notice that even e s no is itself another idea this means you have lots of cases christian a e a yes b e b no g e g yes where g god atheist strong a e a g e g no atheist weak a e i e no g at all in the set agnostic a g e g indeterminate e nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones ,0

 webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions also you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth ah but not everyone knows that god exists so you have a fallacy and that makes it true holding with the bible rules out controversy read the faq if you ve read it you missed something so re read not a bad suggestion for anyone i re read it just before this should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct there are people who have truly never heard of the bible again read the faq bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids god doesn t exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods aren t no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and it s reasonableness certainly doesn t merit eminence divine justice well it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity first not all atheists believe the same things about human nature second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity ,0
sorry bill i had to clear this up there may be good evolutionary arguments against homosexuality but these don t qualify deletions deletions oh i guess all those social insects e g ants bees etc which have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on the way out huh i refer you to the bonobos a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees that is very closely they have sex all the time homosexual as well as heterosexual when the group finds food they have sex before the go to sleep at night they have sex after they escape from or fight off prdators they have sex sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this species a species closely related to humans there is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans as well but even if not this shows that such a function is not impossible sincerely ray ingles ingles engin umich edu,0
 my own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing however when i here people assert that the only true freedom is in following the words of this and that messiah i realise that people don t even agree on the meaning of the word what does it mean to say that word x represents an objective value when word x has no objective meaning ,0
 attempting to define objective morality so long as you keep that almost in there freedom will be a mostly valuable thing to most people that is i think you re really saying a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable to them that s good and a quite nice starting point for a moral system but it s not universal and thus not objective it isn t in sahara ,0

 pitt vs penn state controversy deleted no it wouldn t be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell the point was that recently many messages were posted from that address each of these messages was posted to a different newsgroup with the apparent intent of provoking the readers of that particular group this along with the fact that these posts were written in all caps makes these posts suspect whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly if it is the intended user they should consider appropriate action if it is someone else which seems a possibility then this is also reason to report it we get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread it is only because i have seen posts on other groups by this user that i am considering action ,0

 my argument is mainly a proposal of what i think is a plausible argument against extra marital sex one which i personally believe has some truth my main purpose for posting it here is to show that a plausible argument can be made against extra marital sex at this stage i am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that just that it is plausible to try to convince you all of this particular point of view i would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field etc in order to gather further evidence which i simply do not have time to do now also note that i said that i think extra marital sex is a prime cause in my opinion of the generally greater levels of psychological problems especially depression in western societies i am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause i e one of the significant contributions to this trend i think when you say you think my view is simplistic you have forgotten this i admit that there are probably other factors but i do think that extra marital sex and imo subsequent destabilization of the family is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in western society this century ,0

 humans have gone somewhat beyond what exactly in one thread you re telling us that natural morality is what animals do to survive and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient being can definitely say what is right and what is wrong so what does this omniscient being use for a criterion the long term survival of the human species or what how does omniscient map into definitely being able to assign right and wrong to actions well your original premises have a habit of changing over time so perhaps you d like to review it for us and tell us what the difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign right and wrong to actions and telling us the result is i m talking about the morality introduced by you which was going to be implemented by this omniscient being that can definitely assign right and wrong to actions you tell us what type of morality that is ,0
 or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the messiah or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of jews built into godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of roman oppression or are the moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into jewish embassies dying for the truth hint they think they are were the nazi soldiers in wwii dying for the truth people die for lies all the time was hitler a liar how about napoleon mussolini ronald reagan we spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying so the answer is no they wouldn t be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things why do you think he healed people because the bible says so but if god doesn t exist the other possibility then the bible is not divinely inspired and one can t use it as a piece of evidence as it was written by unbiased observers were hitler or mussolini lunatics how about genghis khan jim jones there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics so we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad possibly self fulfilling prophecy ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general public had access possibly also that the text is written in such riddles like nostradamus that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional prophecy stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted i severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian they are very unconvincing to an unbiased observer ,0
 i jim i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up rallies i didn t beleive real people used it let s see if we agree on the term s definition a homophobe is one who actively and militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of phobe comes from phobia an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings the word is apparently in general use now or perhaps it isn t in the bible wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who has phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isn t that what i said what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs when the members of one generation pass along their traits to subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if i take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our species at least is going nowhere so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children hmm no wonder the world is overpopulated obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm is sacred and if as you say it has a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement natural consider the context i m talking about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who don t have no purpose in that context another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to survive the participation of both parents is necessary a family must exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a family since the majority of humankind is part of a family homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have vanished years ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means i am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there s more read the above i expect you to have at least ten children by now with the family growing these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children these days is just ain t true people can decide whether or not to have children and when soon they will be able to choose it s sex c but that s another arguement so it s more of a lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children both are as unnatural as each other yet another non sequitur sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental that homosexuals don t procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that their sexuality is a preference a life style an orientation a choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is a mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social then it is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they became prominent people are people are people who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy a date here s pretty obvious dodge do you really think you ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement i am not telling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality providing it s a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of the homosexual life style but since the charge is only intended to intimidate it s really just demogoguery and not to be taken seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start again crap all your arguments are based on outdated ideals likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by a bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crushes his penis either accidently or not both are in deuteronomy i m sure your comment pertains to something but you ve disguised it so well i can t see what where did i mention ideals out dated or otherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and biological since any adult is a role model for a child it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily social though that could be extended easily enough you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you one man s meat is another man s poison what has this got to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objections i would really like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly ,0
 ok this is the only thing i will comment on from stan at this time part of this forum we call rec scouting is for policy discussions and related topics this is a policy discussion and involves related topics this is not a fringe group discussion obviously it engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand wether a particular view is anti societal or not is your opinion and yours alone don t try to make it seem otherwise if you do not wish to engage in this discussion use a kill file if you wish to continue in this discussion please do so knowing full well the implications that apply i know for myself that i plan on continuing with the discussion when i have the wish to have input i for one am tired of people trying to say that this is not a matter significant for this group it is and quite so especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely ,0
yesterday i got the chance to hear kurt vonnegut speak at the university of new hampshire vonnegut succeeded isaac asimov as the honorary head of the american humanist association vonnegut is an atheist and so was asimov before asimov s funeral vonnegut stood up and said about asimov he s in heaven now which ignited uproarious laughter in the room from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral it s the funniest thing i could have possibly said to a room full of humanists vonnegut said at yesterday s lecture if vonnegut comes to speak at your university i highly recommend going to see him even if you ve never read any of his novels in my opinion he s the greatest living humorist greatest living humanist humorist as well peace ,0

 i ll take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable i base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom so that their every act was contrary to their volition almost all would want to complain therefore i take it that to assert or believe that freedom is not very valuable when almost everyone can see that it is is every bit as absurd as to assert it is not raining on a rainy day i take this to be a candidate for an objective value and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist ,0

 for all the problems technology has caused your types have made things even worse must we be reminded of the inquisition operation rescue the ku klux klan posse comitatus the club david duke salem witch trials the crusades gay bashings etc plus virtually each and every single war regardless of the level of technology has had theistic organizations cheering on the carnage chaplains etc and claiming that god was in favor of the whole ordeal don t forget to pray for our troops this is really tedious every bad thing that s ever happened is because the malefactors were under the influence of religion does anyone really believe that i ve seen it so often it must be a pretty general opinion in a a but i want to believe that atheists are really not that dishonest please stick to the facts and having accomplished that interpret them correctly ,0
 exodus and if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage yet there is no further injury he shall surely be fined as the woman s husband may demand of him and he shall pay as the judges decide but if there is any further injury then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise the most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry the penalty is only a fine if however the woman is injured or dies the lex talionis doctrine of an eye for an eye applies this is the jewish interpretation and is supported by jewish commentaries on these verses this is quite an embarrassment for pro lifer christians so there is of course an alternate explanation the alternative interprets the word miscarriage to mean premature birth i e the child is born alive and further injury to mean injury to either the woman or the fetus this is not a straightforward interpretation it is not so far as i know supported by any jewish commentaries and it does not appeared to be supported by any other part of the bible what if any historical reference do we have to abortion at this time did the ancient jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion i am truly asking not making a point veiled as a question if there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion it is not surprising the bible makes little reference to it as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination ,0
 well i ve provided examples to show that the trend was general and you or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding mating practices etc i don t think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality and again the mating practices need to be reexamined no but mating practices are a special case i ll have to think about it some more indeed but while the natural system is objective all objective systems are not the natural one so the terms can not be equated the natural system is a subset of the objective ones i don t claim that homosexuality is immoral it isn t harmful although it isn t helpful either to the mating process and when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom don t you mean bisexuality this is standard jargon read any textbook the we forms are used throughout that s right the goals themselves aren t inherent you could but such would contradict observations but a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be true i don t think your postulate would be valid yes and i think the goals of survival and happiness do work you think they don t or are they not good goals ,0
 every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm it is infact re inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for themselves the motto is dangerous in itself it tells the world that every true american is god fearing and puts down those who do not fear gods it doesn t need anyone to make it dangerous it does a good job itself by just existing on your currency the desert brat,0
 define perfect then take your foot out of your mouth i wondered about that already when i was a catholic christian the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why i am an atheist believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time but that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them there is no choice left all is known the course of events is fixed not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will you have said something about choices and the scenario gives them therefore we have what you define as free will imagine the following i can do good to other beings but i cannot harm them easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil but whose case am i arguing it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it or it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing less ,0
 oh bobby you re priceless did i ever tell you that my policy with bobby s posts should anyone give a damn is to flick through the thread at high speed searching for posts of bobby s which have generated a whole pile of followups then go in and extract the hilarious quote inevitably present for sig purposes works for me for the guy who said he s just arrived and asked whether bobby s for real you betcha welcome to alt atheism and rest assured that it gets worse i have a few pearls of wisdom from bobby which i reproduce below is anyone keith keeping a big file of such stuff in allah s infinite wisdom the universe was created from nothing just by saying be and it became therefore allah exists bobby mozumder proving the existence of allah wait you just said that humans are rarely reasonable doesn t that contradict atheism where everything is explained through logic and reason this is the contradiction in atheism that proves it false bobby mozumder proving the existence of allah plus to the believer it would be contradictory to the quran for allah not to exist bobby mozumder proving the existence of allah and now one thing that relates is among navy men that get tatoos that say mom because of the love of their mom it makes for more virile men compare that with how homos are raised do a study and you will get my point bobby mozumder being islamically rigorous on alt atheism mmmmm quality and quantity from the new voice of islam pbuh cheers simon,0
 i lived in tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why i intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can walk anywhere and i mean anywhere at any time of day or night and not feel uneasy even if one s from an ethnic minority as i was clues for bobby why do i bother i tokyo is a city and inner tokyo is an inner city ii there is a negligible level of violent crime and a street murder will be a lead item on national tv news iii the population is almost universally atheistic next time i go for a stroll around beirut at night i ll let you know how it compares cheers simon,0
 god is eternal a b jesus is god c a therefore jesus is eternal c b this works both logically and mathematically god is of the set of things which are eternal jesus is a subset of god therefore jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal everything isn t always so logical mercedes is a car that girl is mercedes therefore that girl is a car ,0
 anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a lie as for people being able to tell if he was a liar well we ve had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization if david copperfield had been the messiah i bet he could have found plenty of believers jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer and he wasn t the first to be witnessed what sets him apart rubbish nations have followed crazies liars psychopaths and megalomaniacs throughout history hitler tojo mussolini khomeini qadaffi stalin papa doc and nixon come to mind all from this century koresh is a non issue take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course there are flaws in your logic everywhere and as i m sure others will tell you read the faq of course you have to believe the bible first just because something is written in the bible does not mean it is true and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible so if you do quote from the bible in the future try to back up that quote with supporting evidence otherwise you will get flamed mercilessly just like weight lifting or guitar playing eh i don t know how you define the world total but i would imagine a total sacrafice sp of everything for god s sake would involve more than a time commitment you are correct about our tendency to box everything into time units would you explain how one should involove god in sports and hehehe television ,0
 i d like this too maybe you should post an answer key after a while nanci,0
 the majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps there seems quite alot of incentive for the british to have control of ni like using the north channel and irish sea as a waste dump i was appalled at the dumping i saw in the harbor in belfast it is my understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water it d be quite a problem if ni got its independence from britain and then stopped accepting the waste are you suggesting that british industry isn t making profit off the situation as well ,0
 didn t you hear his address has changed he can be reached at the following address dkoresh branch davidian compound waco tx us i think he was last seen posting to alt messianic jim,0
 that s the craziest thing i ever heard are you serious it doesn t take much work to be moral really and that s why people discuss morality on a daily basis because it s a kind of evolutionary hangover like your little toe this must be some novel use of the phrase based on with which i am not sufficiently familiar what do you mean by based on and what is the significance of it for your argument well we can what would you like to know about my particular moral beliefs if you raise a topic i ve never considered i ll be quite happy to invent a moral belief out of thin air ,0
 assuming you are presenting it accurately i don t see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion the material in john i m not sure exactly what is referred to here but i ll take for granted the similarity to the matt luke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldn t have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing this is the part that is particularly new to me if it were possible that you could point me to a reference i d be grateful because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable i m not really impressed with the theology argument but i m really pointing this out as an if and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it s agreed that the most important epistles predate mark ,0
this frayed thread has turned into a patented alt atheism on ping pong game and i don t have any strong disagreement so i ll try to stick to the one thing i don t quite follow about the argument it seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the bible was enlightened for its times i e closer to what we would consider morally good based on our standards and past experience on the one hand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on the other hand disclaimer i m speaking from the jewish perspective where the bible means what many call the old testament and where the interpretation is not necessarily the raw text but instead the court cases commentaries and traditions passed down through jewish communities this seems the crux to me if you judge the bible according to a long line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values but if that s how the bible is actually being used today shouldn t that be how we should judge it if most people use scissors to cut paper shouldn t consumer s reports test scissors for paper cutting ability even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth that s possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly interpreted version is what was enlightened for its times to attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that the original scissor makers were unusually advanced at paper cutting for their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even heard of paper i m not arguing that the bible is disgusting though some of the history depicted in it is by modern standards however history is full of similar abuses and i don t think the biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries or possibly ours on the other hand i don t know of any reason to think the history described in the bible shows less abuse than their contemporaries or ours that complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but i still don t think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history ,0
 this is as far as i know complete nonsense the codification of the bible as we have it now came very much later ,0
your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable posts the first i captured was by ken arromdee on feb on the subject re atheist too that was article here your question was article which is an average of about articles a day for the last three years as others have noted the current posting rate is such that my kill file is depressing large among the posting i saved in the early days were articles from the following notables an interesting bunch i wonder where is ,0
 deletion yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology deletion so no fun but i must have met the minority then and given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an no no for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system deletion is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book big deletion no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo logic question is proof of a theology used it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one can t becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place can t it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well deletion sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system deletion if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god ,0
 first of all i m not your buddy second read what i wrote i m not talking about what muslims are allowed to do merely what some practice they consider themselves as muslim as you so don t retort with the old and tired they must not be true muslims bullshit if i gave you the names what will you do with this information is a fatwa going to be leashed out against the perpetrators do you honestly think that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess with the kind of extremism shown by your co religionaries fat chance at any rate there can be no conclusive proof by the very nature of the act perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in theory but hope that allah will forgive them in the end i think it s rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims in this regard also kind of silly are you insinuating that because the koranic law forbids it there are no criminals in muslim countries this is as far as i care to go on this subject the weakness of your arguments are for all netters to see over and out ,0
i have an addition to the faq regarding why are there no atheist hospitals if i recall correctly johns hopkins was built to provide medical services without the backing of a religious group thus making it a hospital dedicated to the glory of weak atheism might someone check up on this ,0
 seconded i cycle to work each day and if we could just get those damned cars and their cretinous drivers off the road it would be a lot more fun ,0
i would like a list of bible contadictions from those of you who dispite being free from christianity are well versed in the bible ,0
 probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis weekends might not be so inviolate more common to work days a week in a business and instead of american atheists we would have similar religious organizations a persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions of course people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions but that could be fun to watch it seems to me that for most people religion in america doesn t matter that much you have extreemists on both ends but a large majority don t make too much of an issue about it as long as you don t now admittedly i have never had to suffer the bible belt but i am just north of it and see the fringes and the reasonable people in most things tend to be reasonable in religion as well i don t bother according a higher value to my thinking or just about anybodys thinking i don t want to fall in that trap because if you do start that then you are then to decide which is better says whom why is there a best and also what to do about those who have inferior modes of thinking idic infinite diversity in infinite combinations i ll argue it over a soda but not over much more just my what inflation has done ,0
 actually it is simple a person p has committed a crime c in country x if p was within the borders of x at the time when c was committed it doesn t matter if the physical manifestation of c is outside x for instance if i hack into nasa s ames research lab and delete all their files i have committed a crime in the united kingdom if the us authorities wish to prosecute me under us law rather than uk law they have no automatic right to do so this is why the net authorities in the us tried to put pressure on some sites in holland holland had no anti cracking legislation and so it was viewed as a hacker haven by some us system administrators similarly a company called red hot television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in britain if they were broadcasting in britain they would be committing a crime but they are not they are broadcasting from denmark so the british government is powerless to do anything about it in spite of the apparent law breaking of course i m not a lawyer so i could be wrong more confusingly i could be right in some countries but not in others ,0
 yeah do you expect people to read the faq etc and actually accept hard atheism no you need a little leap of faith jimmy your logic runs out of steam jim sorry i can t pity you jim and i m sorry that you have these feelings of denial about the faith you need to get by oh well just pretend that it will all end happily ever after anyway maybe if you start a new newsgroup alt atheist hard you won t be bummin so much bye bye big jim don t forget your flintstone s chewables bake timmons iii,0
 hey it might to interesting to read some of these posts especially from ones who still regularly posts on alt atheism hee hee hee i ain t going to say whatever promises that have been made can than be broken ,0
 sorry i don t follow your reasoning you are proposing to punish people before they commit a crime what justification do you have for this ,0
 i don t think such tools exist either in addition there s no such thing as objective information all together it looks like religion and any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose this all reminds me of descartes whispering deamon you can t trust anything so why bother cheers kent,0
 well this is alt atheism i hope you arent here to try to convert anyone many would disagree well you shouldn t give any particular book too much weight actually i don t think that any of these statements is correct it is more likely that most of jesus fame was attributed to him after his death by those who had some strong motives what s a prophecy and what s so significant about them i think we understand well sell your computer and donate you life to your religion now don t waste any time ,0
the latest news seems to be that koresh will give himself up once he s finished writing a sequel to the bible ,0
 lucky for them that the baby didn t have any obvious deformities i could just see it now mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and joseph say that it was god that got her pregnant and then the baby turns out to be deformed or even worse stillborn they d have a lot of explaining to do ,0
you know it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing can be blamed solely on mary so she s married to joseph she gets knocked up what do you think ol joe will do if he finds she s been getting around so mary comes up with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant actually it can t be all that ridiculous considering the number of people that believe it anyway she never tells anyone the truth and even tells poor little jesus that he s hot shit the son of god everyone else tells him this too since they ve bought mary s story so what does mary actually turn out to be an adultress and a liar and the cause of mankind s greatest folly just my recently minted two cents chris ,0
 i ll also add that it is impossible to actually tell when one rejects god therefore you choose to punish only those who talk about it ,0
 you don t think these are little things because with twenty twenty hindsight you know what they led to ,0
 true at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone it seemed to me that they didn t have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare it s like they were only pro gulf war as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up what naive hypocrites discussion about blanket bombing and a bombs deleted i should have said here militarily justified it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified i apologize i have often wondered about this i ve always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan s island fortress of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could ve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us s ulimatum therefore the second bomb was dropped most unfortunate imo i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action if some back water country took over some other back water country we probably wouldn t intervene not that we don t care but we can t be the world s policman or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn t have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west s oil interests caused us to take action i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective well in a sense yes they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is there are no perfect solutions probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order i m not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up you can criticize the system but let s not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant germans perhaps peers doesn t mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers it means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent s motivation s ok granted however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not a court of law the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never used the word conspiracy i don t accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering i m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as let s say we now know that doesn t mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn t see it as being necessary rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it but don t assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified i don t i just don t condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment wrong they were neither moral then nor now they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about months and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that what hogwash if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing regards ,0
 i find these to be intriguing remarks could you give us a bit more explanation here for example which religion is anti semitic and which aesthetic ,0

who kmr po cwru edu keith m ryan what kmr po cwru edu with rush leland stanford edu what apr leland stanford edu kr sadly yes don t loose any sleep over old zlumber just kr have some fun with him but he is basically harmless kr at least if you don t work in ny city i don t find it hard to believe that ole zlumber really believes the hate and ignorant prattle he writes the frightening thought is there are people even worse than he to say that feminism equals superiority over men is laughable as long as he doesn t then proceed to pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike aka the canada slaughter that occured a few years ago but then men killing women is nothing new islamic fundamentalists just have a better excuse qu ran from the vancouver sun thursday october by john davidson canadian press montreal perhaps it s the letter to the five year old daughter that shocks the most i hope one day you will be old enough to understand what happened to your parents wrote patrick prevost i loved your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred police found the piece of paper near prevost s body in his apartment in northeast montreal they say the year old mechanic committed suicide after killing his wife jocelyne parent the couple had been separated for a month and the woman had gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money for food a violent quarrel broke out and prevost attacked his wife with a kitchen knife cutting her throat police said she was only the latest of women slain by a husband or lover in quebec in the last five weeks five children have also been slain as a result of the same domestic battles last year in quebec alone women were slain by their husbands that was more than one third of such cases across canada according to statistics from the canadian centre for justice rest of article ommited then to say that women are somehow better or should be the one to stay home and raise a child is also laughable women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family often more than men in many cultures throughout history seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child and that both should stay home to do so ,0
 deletion for me it is a i believe no gods exist and a i don t believe gods exist in other words i think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless in ontology one can fairly conclude that when a exist is meaningless a does not exist under the pragmatic definition of truth a exists is meaningless makes a exist even logically false a problem with such statements is that one can t disprove a subjective god by definition and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense the trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others deletion ,0

new in this version challenge plus an addendum summarizing charley s responses to date this is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage charley wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently specious claims i ll continue to re post periodically until he answers them publicly indicates that he won t answer them stops posting to alt atheism the alt atheism community tells me to stop or i get totally bored i apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but i m at a loss to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual dishonesty this is re post charley i can t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts i submit that you don t answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task as easy for you as possible i ll present concise re statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will re post this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup i would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice if you can be kind enough to re post or e mail such articles i will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list now to the questions after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi retracting that claim by stating that you weren t referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel don t fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of you failed to do so please do so now question can you name any a a posters who do not fit into your stereotype here is the context for the question you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason you failed to do so please do so now question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning here is the context for the question then later then later then later you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a a posters are unverifiable and fantastical i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made you have failed to do so please do so now question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here is the context for the question then later first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn t help but become atheist i asked you to explain the contradiction your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist you have failed to answer the question please do so now question do you retract your claim that a a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you don t retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism here is the context for the question first quote second quote first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts later you implied that you wouldn t respond because i was putting words in your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text here is the context for the question then later as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation dave wood p s for the record below is a compilation of charley s responses to these challenges to date ,0
 but the goal need not be a subjective one for instance the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species perhaps it wasn t really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary intelligent animals have different needs than the others and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than the law of the jungle i don t think that self actualization is so subjective as you might think and by objectivity i am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely ,0
 in article mar juliet caltech edu lmh juliet caltech edu henling lawrence m writes atheism greek a not theos god belief that there is no god agnosticism greek a not gnostein know belief that it is not possible to determine if there is a god no agnosticism as you have here defined it is a positive belief a belief that it is not possible to determine the existence of any gods that s a belief i m inclined to reject you have also defined atheism here as a positive belief that there is no god a fairly large number of atheists on alt atheism reject this definition instead holding that atheism is simply the absence of belief in a god michael martin in atheism a philosophical justification distinguishes strong atheism my mistake i will have to get a newer dictionary and read the follow up line ,0
 in apr batman bmd trw com responding to dave first with official a a nickname fuller that means that it is an effective anti recidivism measure it does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place the true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering or commiting treason are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the usa that is if there were no death penalty would its introduction deter a would be criminal from committing her his crime i doubt it this is only the first step even if it were a strong deterrent short of being a complete deterrent i would reject it for what about the case of the innocent executed and even if we could eliminate this possibility i would reject the death penalty as immoral this makes me something of a radical on the issue although i think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make i would if magically placed in charge facilitate state aided suicide for criminals who have life sentences this could be a replacement for capital punishment those who don t want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option ,0

 i disagree every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support before one can believe it there are a miriad of factors for each individual as we are all different we quite obviously require different levels of evidence as one pointed out one s history is important while in fussr one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans one would need more evidence than if one lived in the united states the only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the us is if the individual always wear business suits etc the degree of the effect upon the world and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary when determining the level of evidence one needs it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are if the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent please explain why one would not accept the electro magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart remember if the consequences of the law are not relevent then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof if one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law they are irrelevent when theorizing about the truth of the law given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent including the consequence of self contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars how are we ever able to judge what is true or not let alone find the truth by the way what is truth please define before inserting it in the conversation please explain what truth or truth is i do think that anything is ever known for certain even if there is a truth we could never possibly know if it were i find the concept to be meaningless satan and the angels do not have freewill they do what god tells them to do ,0
one thing i think is interesting about alt athiesm is the fact that without bible thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup it almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart oh well that little tidbit aside here is what i really wanted write about how can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible if you want to be religious aren t there more plausable books out there seriously the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other one minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all i think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent unlike the last one they invented for people who say jesus was the son of god didn t god say not to ever put anyone else before him looks like you did just that didn t god say not to make any symbols or idols what are crosses then don t you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track was jesus illiterate why didn t he write anything anyone know i honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot the only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman who s wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream if this posting keeps one person just one person from standing on a streetcorner and telling people they are going to hell i will be happy ,0
 well now we can t judge death until we are dead right so why should we judge religion without having experienced it people have said that religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc but i don t totally agree with this of course we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it so basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual or even for a general population we can say that it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use religion might be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state above ,0
 so instead of calling it interest on deposits you call it returns on investements and instead of calling loans you call it investing in business that is in other words floating stocks in your company no interest is different from a return on an investment for one thing a return on an investment has greater risk and not a set return i e the amount of money you make can go up or down or you might even lose money the difference is the risk of loss is shared by the investor rather than practically all the risk being taken by the borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank but is it different from stocks if you wish to call an investor in stocks as a banker well then its your choice relabeling does not make it interest free it is not just relabeling as i have explained above it is relabeling also its still not interest free the investor is still taking some money as dividend on his investment ofcourse the investor in islamic banking its your so called bank is taking more risk than the usual bank but its still getting some thing back in return also have you heard of junk bonds vinayak vinayak dutt e mail vdp mayo edu standard disclaimers apply,0
 what do you mean by omnipotent here do you mean by omnipotent that god should be able to do anything everything this creates a self contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless to be descriptive omnipotence must mean being all powerful and not being able to do anything everything let me illustrate by analogy suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth suppose further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations the us has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the us see fit the us would be militarily omnipotent but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrine philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian states technically in this scenario the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess but effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of non interference if the policy of non interference were held to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated effectively the us would be limited in what it could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted the us would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non interference policy god is effectively limited in the same sense he is all powerful but he cannot use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he himself is i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence regards ,0

 personally i feel that since religion have such a poweful psychological effect we should let theists be but the problem is that religions cause enormous harm to non believers and to humanity as a whole holy wars inquisitions inter religious hatred impedence of science intellectual progress us them attitudes etc etc need i say more i really don t know what we can do about them any comments i have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else this seems to be ok for atheists you don t get an atheist knocking on your door stopping you in the airport or handing out literature at a social event theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so my sister is a born again and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family for several years she finally got the clue that she couldn t help during that period she bought me i was atheist now i m xtian books for my birthday and xmas several times our birthday cards would contain verses it was a problem i told my mom that i was going to send my sister an atheist piece of reading material i got a don t you dare my mom wasn t religious why did she insist that i not send it because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to preach non religion should be self contained what a crock of shit i finally told my sister that i didn t find her way of life attractive i have seen exactly effort from her on trying to convert me since then i m sick of religious types being pampered looked out for and worst of all respected more than atheists there must be an end in sight ,0

 so these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of their circumstances their genetics their environment their experiences which are not all self determined of course the idea of hell makes the idea of free will dubious on the other hand the idea of hell is not a very powerful idea a parable for you there was once our main character who blah blah blah one day a thug pointed a mean looking gun at omc and said do what i say or i m blasting you to hell omc thought if i believe this thug and follow the instructions that will be given i ll avoid getting blasted to hell on the other hand if i believe this thug and do not follow the instructions that will be given i ll get blasted to hell hmm the more attractive choice is obvious i ll follow the instructions now omc found the choice obvious because everything omc had learned about getting blasted to hell made it appear very undesirable but then omc noticed that the thug s gun wasn t a real gun the thug s threats were make believe so omc ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah ,0
 i was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa against rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally insulting i think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long posting and to say i don t know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying is at the very best quite disingenuous and perhaps even dishonest if anyone care to dig back and read the full posting they will see nothing of the kind i trust you don t deny that islamic teaching has something to do with the fatwa against rushdie ,0

 first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy just what organization did he belong to does it have a name the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was logic alert artificial trifercation the are many other possible explainations could have been that he never existed there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed call me a fool but i believe he did heal people logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn t mean that it isn t true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that don t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes as far as healing goes if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today seems to me that the early gospels weren t that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing or might not have existed or any number of things that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isn t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it jc was a rabbi he knew what those prophecies were it wouldn t be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i don t think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves here i agree with you anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for xians that don t if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity the picking and choosing that i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth jim james l felder sverdrup technology inc phone nasa lewis research center cleveland ohio email jfelder lerc nasa gov some people drink from the fountain of knowledge other people gargle ,0
 stuff deleted that s like saying that since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act it is evil atheism is not a moral system so why should it speak of instructions on how to act atheism is simply lack of belief in god plenty of theists i think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide this is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide however since the atheist set of instructions is the null set how can you show that atheism causes genocide david choweller davec silicon csci csusb edu there are scores of thousands of human insects who are ready at a moment s notice to reveal the will of god on every possible subject george bernard shaw ,0
 secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life islam places the rights of society and every member in it above the rights of the individual this is what i call true human rights as a muslim living in a non muslim land i am bound by the laws of the land i live in but i do not disregard islamic law it still remains a part of my life if the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that i am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then i must leave the land so in a way islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too in an islamic state one ruled by a khaliphate religions other than islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don t affect the genral population and don t come into direct conflict with state laws dhimmis non muslim population are exempt from most islamic laws on religion such as fighting in a jihad giving zakat alms giving etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as military protection and if they are poor they will receive zakat after the fatwa didn t rushdie re affirm his faith in islam didn t he go thru a very public conversion to islam if so he is binding himself to islamic laws he has to publicly renounce in his belief in islam so the burden is on him mas ,0

 this is a good point but i think average people do not take up christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they are kids of immigrants for example since it is the overwhelming major religion in the western world in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong too new or too out of the ordinary seems a little weak but as long as it doesn t hurt anybody these are good quotes and i agree with both of them but let s make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like let him be as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace or something like that of course i suppose if someone were really at peace there would be no need for inflicting evangelism well it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives their popularity seems to come and go i remember when i first entered high school i was an atheist always had been and so were about of my friends at this time of those have converted always to christianity they were all also immigrants from taiwan or sons of immigrants hence my earlier gross generalization christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before since i ve been noticing maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning who knows i for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them so long as we have some set of abstract rights agreements on how we should treat each other i have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions for all the well put arguments on this usenet it never does any good argumentation does not really seem to apply to christians or even some atheists it must simply be a step the person takes naturally almost instinctively best regards adam john cooper verily often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because acooper macalstr edu they had no claws ,0
 xenophobia both de facto and de jure as implemented in legal systems is widespread while the bible although not egalitarian specifically preaches kindness to the stranger and emphasizes in the book of ruth that a foreigner can join the nation and give rise to one of the great heroes of the nation clearly better than the alternative but as an american what strikes me as strange about this story is that it should have even been considered an issue jim there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it s just a happy accident for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value the products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment from teaching training observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside these mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more content is of no consequence the human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn t like it that s it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you ve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality i didn t make these rules it s inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent you have to accept the non significance of any human thought even your own all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever ,0
 well it s obvious that you don t attempt otherwise you would be aware that they don t all loudly claim to be the one true christian i ve tried to avoid using the phrase is is not christian because of these ownership issues instead i ve tried the phrase nicene christianity in an attempt to identify the vast majority of christianity which has roughly similar viewpoints on the core theological issues the jws do not fall within this group and in fact espouse a position known as arianism which is rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well ,0
 the first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements since the is in those statements is the is of predication rather than of identity instead they should be translated using a predicate letter using g to designate god and j to designate jesus and the predicate letter e for the property of being eternal the first premise is eg and the conclusion is ej the second premise appears to contain an is of identity in which case it can be properly symbolized as j g but your remark that jesus is a subset of god suggests that strict identity is not desired here if however the first premise means that all members making up the set god have the property of being eternal the same conclusion follows ,0

 in qvabj g j horus ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp frank o dwyer in article c qgm dl news cso uiuc edu cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike am i making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals where do they come from the question came from the idea that i heard that morals come from whatever is societally mandated it s only one aspect of morality societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going and often it s a little over enthusiastic about doing so individual morality is a different thing it often includes societal mores or society is in trouble but is stronger for example some people are vegetarian though eating meat may be perfectly legal merely a question for the basis of morality moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior who is society depends on the society doesn t help is the point irrelevant no often the answer is we are but if society is those who make the rules that s a different question if society is who should make the rules that s yet another i don t claim to have the answers either but i don t think we do it very well in ireland and i like some things about the us system at least in principle how do they define what is acceptable depends on again this comes from a certain question see above well ideally they don t but if they must they should do it by consensus imo how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position by adopting a default position that people s moral decisions are none of society s business so how can we put people in jail how can we condemn other societies because sometimes that s necessary the hard trick is to recognise when it is and equally importantly when it isn t and only interfering when it s truly necessary why would it be necessary what right do we have to interfere imo it isn t often that interference i e jail and force of various kinds and degrees is both necessary and effective where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question it s a sort of liar s paradox force is necessary for freedom one possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn t object if their own freedom is taken away the paradox doesn t arise if we don t actively wish to take way anyone s freedom the introduction of permissible interference causes the problem that it can be either too much or too little but most people seem to agree that some level of interference is necessary they see the need for a justice system how can we even define that term only by consensus i guess thus you get a situation where the law often allows what honour forbids which i ve come to believe is as it should be i admit i don t understand that statement what i mean is that while thus and such may be legal thus and such may also be seen as immoral the law lets you do it but you don t let yourself do it eating meat for example ,0
 most likely the tragic situation in bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon against other humans and my sympathies are mostly on the bosnian side it looks like the serbs are the oppressors willing to use even christianity as a weapon against their former friends cheers kent,0

 why are only those people in favor of the system to blame if society accepts such a system then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed those that are not in favor should work to convince others and most members of our society have accepted the blame they ve considered the risk to be acceptable similarly every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents this is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving it is all a question of what risk is acceptable it is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed ,0

 mr connor s assertion that more complex later in paleontology is simply incorrect many lineages are known in which whole structures are lost for example snakes have lost their legs cave fish have lost their eyes some species have almost completely lost their males kiwis are descended from birds with functional wings joel the statements i made were illustrative of the inescapably anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process there is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other than teleological that is my whole point even those who have reason to believe they understand evolution biologists for instance tend to personify nature and i can t help but wonder if it s because of the limits of the language or the nature of nature ,0

 deletions deletions as you have presented it it is indeed an argument from incredulity however from what i have seen it is not often presented in this manner it is usually presented more in the form and besides i cannot see nor have i ever been offered a convincing explanation moreover it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena that theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theism s favor especially when different theisms offer different explanations and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations not im my experience in my experience the most common reason is the lack of evidence in theism s favor you mileage may vary oh heck i ll be snide this once it s also fairly easy to attack arguments that are not made i e strawmen sage advice indeed sincerely raymond ingles ingles engin umich edu,0
 when the quran uses the word din it means way of individual thinking behaving communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs this is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion the atheists are not mentioned in the quran along with jews mushriqin christians etc because the latter are all din to have a din you need a set of beliefs assumptions etc to forma a social code for example the marxist have those such as history conflict etc that they do not put idols sometimes they did to represent those assuptions does not mean they are any different from the other mushriq or roughly polytheists there cannot be social atheism because when there is a community that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society when they inscribe assumptions say nation or progress is the natural consequence of human activity or parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government however they individually insist they do not have gods from the quranic point of view they do therefore by definition atheism does not exist we are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than ours atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols gods dogmas suppositions of the society that they part and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief and quran tells about such deviations and disbelief but as i mentioned from a quranic point of looking at things there is no atheism in the macro level i think it took more than one minute ,0
 any suggestions as to what a better solution might be i realize the off hand nature of the numbers i used and i can t answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is however as i said in another post i despise the idea of supporting criminals for life it s the economics of the situation that concern me most the money spent feeding clothing housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places all of which i and probably others would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all americans give people jobs give the homeless shelter any number of things clyde ,0
 the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians either the smart bombs didn t hit their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq s military potential the military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that s war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it s one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse like patrick henry said some years ago i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent so the iraqi war was wrong eh i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and you d be speaking german instead of english right now tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind don t understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn t have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people s sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught liberating kuwait was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map would ve been better and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism regards ,0

 no the argument says john has known q ie a codified version of the logia and not the original assuming that there has been one it has weaknesses of course like that john might have known the original yet rather referred to q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place the argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels not necessarily luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by matthew improving on matthew would give a motive for instance as far as i know the theory that luke has known matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts yep but it will take another day or so to get the source i hope your german is good enough i still do not see how copies from allow to change the dating of john yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence the authencity of many letters is still discussed it looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well well rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the big meeting not necessarily wrong but certainly bad yes but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem ,0
 it s about time why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible anyway face it there are better things to do with your life i used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth etc why do we spend so little time on the mayan religion or the native americans heck the native americans have signifigantly more interesting myths also what about the egyptians i think we pay so much attention to christianity because we accept it as a religion and not a mythology which i find more accurate i try to be tolerant it gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me it s special it s not ,0
 sorry you re right i did not clearly state it the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude once one has accepted the assumption that there is no god s and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict your assumption then i would say there s a lack of consistency here now i know you ll get on me about faith if the positive belief that god does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist sorry for the flamage what is the clipper project btw it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer sickle the stalin example is important not only because it s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought first all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life you can pretend that they don t want this but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god can love as a truth be proven logically john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all many christians i know also boast in this way but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance of course i do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance i speak against strong atheism i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective no apology necessary bake timmons iii,0

 ah now here is the core question let me suggest a scenario we will grant that a god exists and uses revelation to communicate with humans said revelation taking the form paraphrased from your own words this infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck makes him take dictation and then hides away for a few hundred years now there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation this person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world which is all this person has ever seen but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation now based on this can this person be blamed for concluding absent a personal revelation of their own that there is almost certainly nothing to this revelation thing absent this better language and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing here is what i am driving at i have thought a long time about this i have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that i am familiar with now if there does happen to be say a christian god will i be held accountable for such an honest mistake sincerely ray ingles ingles engin umich edu,0

 reply to zazen austin ibm com e h welbon for many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence it is a reliable way of knowing there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof even when we agree to take someone elses word on faith we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing rather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faith is in gods or no gods the theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times for example in his work as a scientist the atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge without evidence why should we believe in gods rather than santa claus or the easter bunny i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn t require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods i don t believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the lack of facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found ,0

 regardless of people s hidden motivations the stated reasons for many wars include religion of course you can always claim that the real reason was economics politics ethnic strife or whatever but the fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer the heathens if you want to say for instance that economics was the chief cause of the crusades you could certainly make that point but someone could come along and demonstrate that it was really something else in the same manner you show that it was really not religion you could in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the crusades scott i don t have to make outrageous claims about religion s affecting and effecting history for the purpsoe of a a all i have to do point out that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate atheism at no time have i made any statement that religion was the sole cause of anything what i have done is point out that those who do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately to credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course history i believe that those who distort history in this way know exaclty what they re doing and do it only for affect ,0
 this is a good point but i think average people do not take up christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they are kids of immigrants for example since it is the overwhelming major religion in the western world in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong too new or too out of the ordinary seems a little weak but as long as it doesn t hurt anybody the social pressure is indeed a very important factor for the majority of passive christians in our world today in the case of early christianity the promise of a heavenly afterlife independent of your social status was also a very promising gift reason slaves and non romans accepted the religion very rapidly if this is a hypothetical proposition you should say so if it s fact you should cite your sources if all this is the amateur sociologist sub branch of a a however it would suffice to alert the unwary that you are just screwing around ,0

archive name atheism introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modified april version begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathew mantis co uk this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup was created some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on alt atheism so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not what is atheism atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it is important to note the difference between these two positions weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists some atheists believe in the non existence of all gods others limit their atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making flat out denials but isn t disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn t exist definitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not which brings us to agnosticism what is agnosticism then the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exists words are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming that you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say for sure is that atheists don t believe in god for example it certainly isn t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist it s best to ask her many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially self contradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists but isn t it impossible to prove the non existence of something there are many counter examples to such a statement for example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers of course this deals with well defined objects obeying well defined rules whether gods or universes are similarly well defined is a matter for debate however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of god if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isn t there such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they don t exist therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most of the time they don t believe in unicorns even though they can t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any present day religion exists in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently different that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable but what if god is essentially non detectable if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if god is essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other things that don t exist ok you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism but isn t it still a religious belief one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points out that it can t be true person a gradually re defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept he then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to it and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isn t atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship it s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as science politics and watching tv ok so it s not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is firstly it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt science has a number of core assumptions for example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesn t really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist if atheism is not religious surely it s anti religious it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth is not so clear cut atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be anti religion however when religious believers speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries a few atheists are quite anti religious and may even try to convert others when possible historically such anti religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example the government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that s the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters for example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say what about prayer in schools if there s no god why do you care if people pray because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who don t pray can t just ignore also christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non christians even if they are told that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals don t atheists object to the religious charities there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in connection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity many feel that it s somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea it s rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelical you said atheism isn t anti religious but is it perhaps a backlash against one s upbringing a way of rebelling perhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists it s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others on the whole we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheists differ from religious people they don t believe in god that s all there is to it atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around for arguing against of course whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance unexceptional but aren t atheists less moral than religious people that depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheists are less moral as they don t obey any god but usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of self preservation many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they care what happens to others they don t know they simply are that way naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seems that for every atheist mass murderer there is a religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour is there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being then aren t atheists just theists who are denying god a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual s personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but don t atheists want to believe in god atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be some atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks of such an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to see many if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded comments such as of course god is there you just aren t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it s a decision for the individual concerned most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that s just hard luck don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong the short answer is no do you many atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of the existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it so why should theists question their beliefs don t the same arguments apply no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheism is a negative belief theism is a very strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind it s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on imagine how that effort could be better spent many theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds it is arguable that the catholic church s opposition to birth control and condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world wide religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion those weren t real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse what makes a real believer there are so many one true religions it s hard to tell look at christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide who s a real christian and who isn t when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england can t decide amongst themselves in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support un christian acts it can t be much of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldn t he have made it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefs aren t a perversion of what your god intended if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicorns don t exist but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still well if atheism s so great why are there so many theists unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand of course there s more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well but so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say something not really most religions are only superficially similar for example it s worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing not entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far the theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheism there are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just a few of them don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it s up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it s probably the only one you ll have it s no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good if you must assume something assume something it s easy to test don t believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question thanks for taking the time to read this article mathew begin pgp signature version iqcvagubk

 it is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original arabic regarding the verses relevant to nature i prefer to use dr maurice bucaille s translations in his book the bible the qur an and science for in general his translations are more literal maurice bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator s interpolation it is not existent in the original arabic which is why it is included in brackets you re right what the verses do contain isn t all that remarkable however dr bucaille a surgeon that s how he s a dr thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the th century or so and this goes for the rest of the qur an as well which has about verses or so regarding nature i think i remember reading once ,0

 if you were omniscient you d know who exactly did what and with what purpose in mind then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal in an objective system there are known goals then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not simple the problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ that is the goals of each society are different note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one i ve said it many many times which part do you have a problem with but we can enslave the animals right but just not kill them or are you a vegetarian for health reasons no i fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway of course not it seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food it might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer for instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild they seem happy enough however the veal youngsters aren t treated very well i don t know what is the goal of this particular system there is no inherent system nope again it seems okay to kill other species for food ,0

 from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions over the phone one must need some brains i would expect i read this in an article in the australian muslim times the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate i don t deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption b islam teaches us not to harm innocents if muslims who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this perform such actions it is not because of the teachings of islam but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of islam this is an important distinction i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam the term muslim is to be contrasted with mu min which means true believer however whether a muslim is in reality a mu min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu min used very much by muslims in alt atheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a true believer or not for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing thus when we say muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings by muslim we do not necessarily mean mu min or true believer in islam ,0
 this book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue the book is in two sections section contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the bible showing many inconsistencies between the bible and modern science well we all know that no surprises section analyses the koran s version of the old testament stories and seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the koran is consistent with modern science however it was plain to me that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the koran take the flood for example the bible is full of detail forty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc we all know this is nonsense the koran s description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as a big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage yes no contradiction but also not much fact the koran might be consistent with modern science but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time does not seem much of an achievement the book concludes by saying something like the koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of to us now ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of them can be found in the koran arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme the above is of course from memory so i may have missed some points ,0

 deletion no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premises and the argument used no that s a word game the term god is used in a different way usually when you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way i define god is and that does not exist it is existence itself so i say it does not exist interestingly there are those who say that existence exists is one of the indubitable statements possible further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy deletion deletion where does that follow aren t observations based on the assumption that something exists and wouldn t you say there is a level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway ,0
 ahhh go back to alt autotheism where you belong ,0
 deletion you have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes repeating offenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at all typically religious doublespeak whenever you have contradictory statements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument it is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make theodore kkkaldis feel cozy can go along under the protection of religion ,0
 it is all written in the wholly babble the users guide to invisible pink unicorns to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns you must read the babble and obey what is written in it to obey what is written in the babble you must believe that doing so is the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns to believe that obeying what is written in the babble leads to believing in invisible pink unicorns you must essentially believe in invisible pink unicorns this bit of circular reasoning begs the question what makes obeying different from believing ,0
 that s right and this is pretty impossible right it would be ideal if we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then determine which course of thought suits us best but again this is not possible not that religion warrants belief but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits there are also some psychological burdens too well if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing in racism of course the parallel happens to be a poor one but you originated it ,0
well it looks like the folks in soc religion islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking interest topic a few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned these may be hard to find but i think i may take a stab at it out of curiosity i know the one film i saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes i have seen which were used to show science in the koran which i posted here were also pretty vague i suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have at least one poster on the islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the koran to decide what is good science i wonder if islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the christians creation science on any topic it would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the koran to see if anyone used the koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded it is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passages to match those findings people do similar things with the sayings of nostradamus all the time ,0

 no mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer what he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals this may not on the surface sound like a bad thing but who defines what a potential criminal is if the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice this is not conducive to a free society mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly therefore a deterrant to future offenders mathew sees it most probably as a means of rehabilitation for the offender so he was being cynical at you okay ,0

 i could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout back in the s the issue wasn t gays but the principles were the same thanks for a well put testimonial stan krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn t belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice the bsa has been hijacked by the religious right but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven t given up seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for on a cautionary note you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the bsa you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it word could leak out to the bsa gestapo ,0
 you know it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing can be blamed solely on mary so she s married to joseph she gets knocked up what do you think ol joe will do if he finds she s been getting around so mary comes up with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant nice attempt chris verrry close you missed the conspiracy by step joseph knew who knocked her up he couldn t let it be known that somebody else got ol mary prego that wouldn t do well for his popularity in the local circles so what happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and they decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both clever indeed come to think of it i have gained a new respect for the couple maybe joseph and mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus ,0

 it was no criticism of islam for a change it was a criticism of the arguments used namely whenever people you identify as muslims are the victims of the attacks of others they are used an argument for the bad situation of muslims but whenever deeds by muslim that victimize others are named they do not count as an argument because what these people did was not done as a true muslims no mention is made how muslims are the cause of a bad situation of another party ,0
 see we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here earlier you said that it must be a conscious act by your definition no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality you are trying to apply human terms to non humans i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative this does not prevent his behavior from being moral i try to show it but by your definition it can t be shown and morality can be thought of a large class of princples it could be defined in terms of many things the laws of physics if you wish however it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of phyics it is less silly to talk about animals as they have at least some free will ,0

 you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half truths about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it isn t too long i haven t read lewis s article so i can t comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti islamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half truths again read orientalism by edward said i am not asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well known book and check the evidence out for yourself if slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i understand your point of view selim i think rather it is us who are not getting through to you some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and women reposted from soc religion islam if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves my posting on slavery the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year is based completely on the qur an and contains numerous qur anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur an and hadiths now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur an prohibits drinking now if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that islam does not support a free market for it does in general but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is for example anti education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur an or not the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the qur an that muslims are backwards in education selim it is your thesis that is anti historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this i think selim you should consider taking your own advice here too selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start reading some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have ,0
 which objective system are you talking about what is its goal again which brand of morality are you talking about ,0
 seems he didn t understand anything about realities liar lunatic or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of jesus message sigh it seems religion makes your mind brain filter out anything that does not fit into your personal scheme so anyone that thinks the possibilities with jesus is bound to the classical lewis notion of liar lunatic or saint is indeed bound to become a christian cheers kent,0
 i agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what i meant by my previous statements about islam not being anarchist and the law not being enforcible despite the law being applicable i disagree with this conclusion about the applicability of the islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be the above conclusion does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion that the fatwa cannot be enforced according to islamic law however i do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to rushdie even were it well founded certainly putting a price on the head of rushdie in britain is a criminal act according to islamic law yes ,0
 could you explain what any of the above pertains to is this a position statement on something or typing practice satan and the angels do not have freewill they do what god tells them to do ,0
 i agree i had a hard feeling not believing my grand grand mother who told me of elves dancing outside barns in the early mornings i preferred not to accept it even if her statement provided the truth itself life is hard cheers kent,0
 okay i argued this thoroughly about weeks ago men and women are different physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copy and read it their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different maternity leave is an example of this it takes into account that women get pregnant it does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different now people make the naive argument that sexism oppression however maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist no matter however much a man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law is sexist no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant i hope this is clear maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist there is no official priesthood in islam much of this function is taken by islamic scholars there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam an example from early islamic history is the prophet s widow aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and i dispute it i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the heading islam and women if it is still at your news site i suggest you read it it is reposted from soc religion islam so if it has disappeared from alt atheism it still might be in soc religion islam i forgot what its original title was though i will email it to you if you like your statement that other religions are no different is i think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism aisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader the prophet s first wife who died just before the hijra the prophet s journey from mecca to medina was a successful businesswoman lucio you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions ,0
 leonard i ll give you an example of this my father recently bought a business the business price was pounds and my father approached the people in the community for help he raised pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and muslims he knew had cash and the rest he got a business loan after paying off the muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest this is an example of a muslim community helping one another why did they help because of their common identity as muslims in turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community the fact is leonard it does work without a fluffy bunny in sight ithat is the beauty of islam mas ,0

 unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous re writing more carefully we have at least two possibilities the first things called mercedes are cars that girl is called mercedes therefore that girl is a car that is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction it is not sound because the first statement is false similarly i would hold that jim s example is valid but not sound another possible interpretation of what you wrote is there exists at least one car called mercedes that girl is called mercedes therefore that girl is a car which isn t valid ,0
 deletion ,0
 i m not saying this at all it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because i ve seen it drive i ve done more than at in fact i ve actually driven it now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what s out there but there is no evidence pro or con for the existence or non existence of god see what i have to say below on this sorry if i remain skeptical i don t believe it s entirely a conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the non existence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive i have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life evolution when i draw the conclusion that pink unicorns don t exist because i haven t seen them this conclusion has it s foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such god however has no such correspondence with anything imo there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from i disagree with you profoundly on this i haven t defined god as existence in fact i haven t defined god but this might be getting off the subject although if you think it s relevant we can come back to it you are using wrong categories here or perhaps you misunderstand what i m saying i m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy i m not trying to convince you of anything i believe and that rests upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary btw an incomplete argument is not a fallacy some things are not even wrong i don t follow you here certainly one can make observations of things that they didn t know existed i still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god does not exist such a positive assertion requires a leap once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat i however am not doing this i am arguing one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap it requires faith i am as you would say a theist however there is a form of atheism that i can respect but it must be founded upon honesty ,0
 perhaps not in christianity but in islam the choice of religious leaders is to be made by the people so much for your superiority argument democracy is a basic element of islam learn that one ever notice that the so called fundamentalists in algeria who are being repressed by the secular government won in free and democratic elections ,0

 you and mr bobby really need to sit down and decide what exactly islam is before posting here according to zlumber one is not a muslim when one is doing evil a muslin can do no evil according to him one who does evil is suffering from temporary athiesm now would the members who claim to be muslims get their stories straight satan and the angels do not have freewill they do what god tells them to do ,0
 the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime if so why doesn t every crime carry a death penalty that would be effictive wouldn t it the death penalty is a punishment much like a fine for speeding is a punishment anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesn t much care about the consequences i think another problem is that people dont think they will get caught if i wanted to kill another person i wouldn t care what the penalty was if i didn t think i would get caught if it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along the lines of torture ,0
 this thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint according to some utilitarian principle i e atheism religion is wrong because it causes death the underlying moral is that death is wrong this is a rather arbitrary measure of validity get some epistemology ,0

 i don t think we need to argue about this yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs and actually i think that the government already does recognize that christianity is the dominant religion in this country i mean it is don t you realize recognize this this isn t to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of christianity just that most people do if you agree with me then what are we discussing no but i hear quite a bit about christmas and little if anything about jesus wouldn t this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him or are you saying that the association with jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it that is can you prove that most people do associate christmas most importantly with jesus i think the numbers do matter it takes a majority or at least a majority of those in power to discriminate doesn t it ,0

 it s not really their decision to be tried the rulings do have legal consequences but only in islamic law and not in uk law this should be obvious enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment take for example the judgments of the world court this is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which are important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced of course have you read any of this thread before this post of course it is a sort of anarchism anarchism is explicitly against islam thank you for your well reasoned response but it is beside the points i ve been making in this thread ,0

 yes i fully agree with that but is it i don t believe gods exist or i believe no gods exist as mandtbacka finabo abo fi mats andtbacka pointed out it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism at least according to the faq atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it is important to note the difference between these two positions weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists from mathew s an introduction to atheism version last modified apr should the faq be clarified to try to pin down this notion of belief can it ,0
frank d s uucp frank o dwyer writes while i ll agree that these are generally held to be good things i question whether they come very close to being objective values especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable i doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally good or bad and when i referred to the truth i was using the term hypothetically realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing true enough but they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals one thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of personal accountability the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority aka absolute moral truth an objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth interesting notion certainly one can have as one s morals a belief that compromise is good but to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully i suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise how do you compromise on compromising almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another be it morals or consequences people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief in justifying a commitement to peace i might argue that it lets people live long healthy and peaceful lives while that much may well be true it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war killing off the most agressive member of society trimming down the population stimulating production the equation is always more complex than presented to characterize relative morals as merely following one s own conscience desires is to unduly simplify it ,0

 for several years i ve periodically asked charley wingate to explain this mythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiastically when he pops up every few months his reluctance to explain indicates to me that it s not so hot i ve said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you might have caught on by now and there is no alternative but the point is rationality isn t an alternative either the problems of metaphysical and religious knowledge are unsolvable or i should say humans cannot solve them if there is truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim the usual line here which you call a prejudgment of atheism and dispute is that reason is all we have here you admit that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts with religious knowledge this sounds very much like i can t provide a rational defense for my belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false i hope it makes you happy but your repeated and unfounded assertions to this effect don t advance your cause ,0

my turn to jump in i think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient just ask any assembly programmer the oft quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights is a complete lie and deception as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost almost always at the cost to another whos liberty is more inalienable similarly for right of life when one person must die if he is to save another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty especially for serial killers whos life and liberty is more valuable the serial killer or the victim according to that beautiful line those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be able to remove them this includes government admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people s life and or liberty but is not his own life liberty inviolate also according to the declaration of independence it is oooh i like that it means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will reason an infant has no will as such similarly for people who are brain dead easier to see in a coma etc also under current law accidental killing is still murder how will you include that the only real golden rule in life is he who has the gold makes the rules i e might makes right that is survival now what is wrong with that if you mean the golden rule as i stated yes almost every system as implemented has used that in reality sorry i don t deal as much in fiction as i do in reality welcome to ozland what is not arbitrary if you can find some part of society some societal rules morals etc that are not arbitrary please tell me i don t think there are any sounds like euphemisms to me the difference seems to be that objective is some reasoning that i like while arbitrary is some reasoning that i don t like or don t understand ,0
 i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population i ve been thinking about this every now and then since i cut my ties with christianity it is surprising to note that a large majority of people at least in finland seem to be apatheists even though of the population are members of the lutheran church of finland religious people are actually a minority could it be possible that many people believe in god just in case it seems people do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to pascal s wager or other poor arguments a small minority of those who do believe reads the bible regularly the majority doesn t care it believes but doesn t know what or how people don t usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open a christian would say that they are not born in the spirit but this does not disturb them religion is not something to think about i m afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many people take the poison with a smile or just pretend to swallow and unconsciously hope god wouldn t notice also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishness if logic and reason are valued then i would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in i ve yet to see good reasons to believe in gods or to take a leap of faith at all a revelation would do however why do we value logic and reasoning this questions bears some resemblance to a long disputed problem in science why mathematics works strong deep structuralists like atkins have proposed that perhaps after all everything is mathematics is usefulness any criterion petri ,0

 i would be happy to discuss the issue of the imams with you although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup i feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate the topic is deeply embedded in the world view of islam and the esoteric teachings of the prophet s a heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical substance of man s being and nature a good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory books to islam in general is murtaza mutahhari s fundamental s of islamic thought god man and the universe mizan press translated by r campbell truly a beautiful book a follow up book if you can find a decent translation is wilaya the station of the master by the same author i think it also goes under the title of master and mastership it s a very small book really just a transcription of a lecture by the author the introduction to the beautiful psalms of islam translated by william c chittick available through muhammadi trust of great britain is also an excellent introduction to the subject we have these books in our university library i imagine any well stocked university library will have them from your posts you seem fairly well versed in sunni thought you should seek to know shi ite thought through knowledgeable shi ite authors as well at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled ,0

 when the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers act in a certain way and we observe that they don t we have a contradiction something defined contradictorily cannot exist that what the believe in does not exist secondly there are better explanations for why they believe than the existence of the object of their belief have you read the faq already benedikt benedikt i can t recall anyone claiming that god makes anyone act a particlar way i think that you re attempting to manufacture a contradiction god is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is the believer s sense of duty a standard of conduct does exist but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient but our response to god s edicts can in no way be used to question god s existence the behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of god s existence there is nothing contradictory here to say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar all you can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rat s nest of unnecessary complexity i think i know what you re implying but i d like to see your version of this better alternative just the same ,0

 reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story that is a bigger headline let s back up to at this point we have the masoretic text the various targums translations commentaries in aramaic etc and the septuagint the ancient greek translation the masoretic text is the standard jewish text and essentially does not vary in some places it has obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the septuagint now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text in addition to fixing predating the various corrupted passages it must be emphasized that to the best of my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and have little theological import the dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books there is also an abundance of other material but as far as i know there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the septuagint as far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations between the dss texts and the masoretic versions these tend to reflect the septuagint where the latter isn t obviously in error again though the differences thus far are not significant theologically there is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material but so far this hasn t happened the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the ot unlike for the nt ,0

is it just me or has this part gotten beyond useful gregg is not as i understand his posts giving any support to the bounty on rushdie s life if that s correct end of one point gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most westerners don t accept his comments about islamic law i think make a great deal of sense to him and are even making a little sense to me now if a person is a member of a group religion or whatever they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum the big bone of contention here that i m picking up is that in the west we have secular governments that maintain more or less a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups i think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune note i didn t say in agreement with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen with that in mind it not possible under secular law legally as most people would define the term to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort contractual etc is there any secular enforcement allowed by a group to a group member or past group member a religion can and often does believe in and require additional duties of a group member and it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways ostracism is common for example but the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and or unaccepted onus on a person in conflict with secular law this is the difference in a theocracy the requirements of the secular authorities are by definition congruent with the religious authorities outside a theocracy this is not necessarily true religious requirements may coincide or may not similiarly religious consequences may or may not coincide with secular consequences if any regards dew,0
 fred rice answered this already in an early posting the problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real believer and who may be faking it this is something known only by the person him herself and god your assumption that anyone who claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true in other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and false muslim we are back to square one khomeini and hussein are still innocent and can t be defined as evil or good islamic worshippers cheers kent ,0

 that s not true i gave you two examples one was the rather pevasive anti semitism in german christianity well before hitler arrived the other was the system of social ranks that were used in imperail germany and austria to distinguish jews from the rest of the population neither of these were very terrible in themselves but both helped to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of jews was made easier ,0
i apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted i ve been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because i had a son born the day after umar s article was posted btw i did respond within a couple of days but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world this is a revision of that original response this was in response to the claim that rushdie made false statements about the life of mohammed with the disclaimer fiction i know but where is the line between fact and fiction i stand by this distinction between fiction and false statements i had not seen that claim or i might have been less sweeping you have made what i consider factual misstatements about events in the book which i have raised in the past in the islam a clearer view thread as well as the root of the yet more rushdie re islamic law thread my statement was not that you had not read the book but that you had not convinced me that you inter alia had as i said before if you want to defend your position then produce evidence and respond to the evidence i have posted so far you have not of course my statement was not directly aimed at you but broadly at a number of muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book indicating that they haven t read it and narrowly at gregg jaeger who subsequently admitted that he hadn t in fact read the book vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case so far the only things i have to go on regarding your own case are a the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view posting which i have challenged not interpretation but statements of fact for instance rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of islam as whores and b your claim which i had not seen before this that you have indeed read it cover to cover i am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation but you ll have to support your end by responding to my criticism i have no doubt as to the ability of a particular muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at but you have upheld the view that tsv is intended as an attack on islam and upon muslims this view must be defended by more than mere assertion if you want anyone to take it seriously and i appreciate it but welcome to the club i am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated or otherwise insulting attack on islam and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book i have seen is baseless propaganda i have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in context quotes from the book and rushdie s essays which is more than my correspondents have done of course you are more than welcome to do so ,0

 at the cost of repudiating the faq i think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of alt atheism where we re continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists believe in the non existence of god i think the separation is a valid one to cover my arse what i m trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism i wish whereas i logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect i am a strong atheist and wish i could be a mathematical one to justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty if i read the faq correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been found to be unassailable to me this is adequate evidence that the real god is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight which in turn i accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god i m a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject ,0

 how about this description an object that is at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle i hold that no object satisfying this description could exist the description is inconsistent and hence describes an object that could not exist now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said that object is at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle this does not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description was incorrectly applied the atheist says the descriptions of god that i have been presented with are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist now your position so far as i can gather is that god exists but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of it this is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one are told that it is a euclidean circle square can they be blamed for doubting rather strongly that this bicycle exists at all no kidding sincerely ray ingles ingles engin umich edu,0

 yes and everyone thinks as you do no one thinks that he is going to cause or be involved in a fatal accident but the likelihood is surprisingly high just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting blanks does not mean that you are less guilty you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation and you should note that that situation will never occur there are always other options thank killing why don t you just say that all killing is wrong this is basically what you are saying are you attempting to be condescending but most people have found the risk to be acceptable you are probably much more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electric blender than you are to be executed as an innocent i personally think that the risk is acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such risk is acceptable acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such an approximation to the ideal ,0

 there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively this definition does not include all atheists see the faq however i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is science however science has one advantage theology doesn t it is self correcting with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent simple picture of our universe science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it s just a happy accident maybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which don t don t make it recommended reading t o for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective i value events and things subjectively from my perspective nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective values arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starters how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values c s lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument is severely flawed some values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against one s own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people of other nations at the time of the nt things were quite different the jews were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles a new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born a mutation in a meme pool since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn t like it that s it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense it looks like you haven t bothered to read philosophy whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and other s happiness too if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this includes gods too their values are only their personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence morality is not property of humans alone chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you ve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which does not exist any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective from a non observers non point of view values do not exist neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are inherently subjective once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we don t i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one s own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else bill take note absolute values must be independent of any being including gods if god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals are his own petri ,0
 hi adda most bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time the time when the author wrote it unfortunately like all works from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies there are parts of books scraps really that date from around the mid second century a d there are some complete books letters etc from the middle third century the first complete collection of the new testament dates from the early th century a d throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings if you mean that someone discovered thousands of bibles which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the st century no if you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the dates given above but not letter perfect and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime shortly after a d then yes from the original authors we call them matthew mark luke john peter paul james and one other not identified as long as you make it regards ,0
 really no gravity is an inherent system you don t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything it is possible to objectively determine someone s guilt or innocence within an non inherent system i agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory perhaps it can be objective but not inherent anyway as i noted before the practices related to mating rituals etc among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law therefore some revisions are in order since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems it seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design i think i have it is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors etc an immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc depending on the goal of the system that is immoral to what end ,0

 last night while watching the a m rebroadcast of jerry springer a talk show i heard this jewel of a thought from a year old racist the focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the jewish religion and why some stuff deleted interesting and scary no they went on to say how the jews had killed their god and how in the end of time that all the races would go to their homelands of course they would remain in america which is new jeruselem as it says in gen what another kid said but the rest of the races would go home and then the great battle or plague or whatever revel says would happen and the jews would be killed the most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is catholic and had the kjv of the bible on his desk he immediatly opened it up and began to search for the quoted passages gen rev and john to look for himself and couldn t find what they said they saw i don t know i saw this show a while back and when i heard these kids quote the bible to justify their racist claims i looked up that quote about jesus hating jews since jesus himself was a jew my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim the jist of the passage and i am sorry but i can t recall which passage it was exactly was that jesus was condemning the pharisees for being corrupt of course the pharisees were jewish too but it wasn t jews as a whole that jesus was condemning just the powers that be ,0

 there are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists and theists i m sure bobby can list quite a few for the atheist side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at genocide perhaps since i m a bit weak on history somone here would like to give a list of wars caused led by theists i can think of a few hitler claimed to be a christian for example but a more complete list would probably be more effective in showing bobby just how absurd his statement is on a side note i notice you always sign your posts peace perhaps you should take your own advice and leave the atheists in peace with their beliefs nanci,0
 logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn t mean that it isn t true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself cite this is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the christian account of things in the words of st madalyn murrey o hair face it folks it s just silly why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it s a fallacy ,0
 ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideologies i don t think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human nature i would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me one must approach the qur an with intelligence any thinking approach to the qur an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven or to have a great reward understood to be in the after life i think the usual answer would be no in which case the part saying for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls if it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then i have no idea what a soul is as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the qur an has to give all verses of the qur an equal priority that is because according to muslim belief the whole qur an is the revelation of god in fact denying the truth of any part of the qur an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in islam look any approach to the qur an must be done with intelligence and thought it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the quran s message in a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you i think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have souls from the above verse let s try to understand what the qur an is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage the misinterpretations of the qur an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited let s try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist islam for their own ends something i do not deny but provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever ,0
 if a person gives a well balanced reasoned argument tammy then all are happy to discuss it with him if he makes astounding claims which are not backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them if the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not supportable then people would have simply ignored him he did not he claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed his argument was for christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe him and his message i for one will not take things as read if you told me that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark side of jupiter then i would demand evidence adda ,0
 my previous posting deleted the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history and ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany that s right there have been there have also been people who were formally nazis but the nazi party would have gone nowhere without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the street who behaved as though casual anti semitism was perfectly acceptable now what exactly don t you understand about what i wrote and why don t you see what it has to do with the matter at hand ,0
 stuff deleted more stuff deleted hmm usenet got it s collective hooks into me around or so right after i switched to engineering i d say i started reading alt atheism around i ve probably not posted more than messages in the time since then though i ll never understand how people can find the time to write so much i can barely keep up as it is ,0
 the corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak comparison of the current hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text has in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia this shouldn t be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner are likely to makes some pains to make good copies tell it to king james mate c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod mangoe cs umd edu yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god ,0

i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population it is rather a ridiculous question in some ways i know but my newsreader is down so i am not getting any new postings for a bit so i figure i might as well post something new myself also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishness idle thoughts adam,0

 oh your highness and exactly why should the quotation marks enclose laws not must in case you didn t notice it s the function of the must that i wish to ironicise perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour died out and we are left with the ones that did evolve such behaviour entirely by chance are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an organism evolves cooperative behaviour what about the natural morality of bee dance ,0

 i love it i love it i love it wish i could fit all that into a sig file if someone is keeping a list of bobby quotes be sure to include this one the flat earthers state that the earth is flat is a fact i don t accept this i think it s an unproven opinion and i think the round earthers are right because they have better evidence than the flat earthers do although i can t prove that a god doesn t exist the arguments used to support a god s existence are weak and often self contradictory and i m not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that i absolutely can t ignore a while ago i read an interesting book by a fellow called von daenicken in which he proved some of the wildest things and on the last page he wrote something like can you prove it isn t so i certainly can t but i m not going to believe him because he based his proof on some really questionable stuff such as old myths he called it circumstancial evidence so far atheism hasn t made me kill anyone and i m regarded as quite an agreeable fellow really ,0
 i see it is not rational but it is intellectual does madness qualify as intellectual engagement too exactly why science uses mathematics qm representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology nor is it supposed to be the truth as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language admittedly not every religion says so but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between religions and qm allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being similar show me something similar in religion with the effect that the models presented are useless and one can argue that the other way around namely that the only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified showing that it is bogus ,0

 reply to frank d s uucp frank o dwyer from a dictionary of philosophy by anthony flew objectivism the belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired for instance no one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a plausible example even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the contention remains true just as remains correct even if there is no one left to count the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action guiding content one ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths but can he deny the subjectivist s claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity ,0
 well this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt atheism where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system without resorting to accusing others of bigotry it s somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec scouting since i always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity i understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or other inconsequential characteristics all the evidence i ve seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics thus pending further evidence i conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory ,0

 i pondered it for all of ten seconds when i realised that since we don t have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity and since the whole issue of depression isn t at all well defined for earlier centuries you are probably talking crap of course you could pull a mozumder on us and say that people who are having sex outside marriage are defined to be depressed i can t say i d ever noticed myself ,0
 is the distinction important well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways i don t know what is wrong is it possible for humans to survive for a long time in the wild yes it s possible but it is difficult humans are a social animal and that is a cause of our success isn t it why don t you think so no as noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality isn t really destructive to the system it is a worst neutral again the mating practices are something to be reexamined ,0
 yes i do my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people that is it s primary and i would argue only purpose to continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing innocents is unconscionable at the very least the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society not their detriments we are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems one has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment just in case i wasn t clear again we maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain why were you to pin me in a corner and ask i would have to respond that i don t belief the state should have the right to take life at all but i won t open that debate as it seems others are tiring of this thread on a a anyway bob beauchaine bobbe vice ico tek com they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea ,0

 reference line trimmed well i d say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder for instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually performed the action isn t the murderer but i guess this is actually made clear in the below definition what do you mean by reasonable yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition but even though the series is recursively infinite i think the meaning can still be deduced math lesson deleted okay let s look at this situation suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family now let s suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times or if you don t like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing that is there is a never ending loop of slayings based on some non existent travesty how do you resolve this well they are all murders now i suppose that this isn t totally applicable to your problem but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system and in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity and a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved so the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition see in a totally objective system where all the information is available such a nested definition isn t really a problem ,0
 i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one i simply don t agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy qur an the bible etc there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven hell and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time as i mentioned in the tradition cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic which begs the question if satan in this case is metaphorical how can you be certain allah is not the same way the bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing color to a person who has been blind from birth you may want to read the book flatland if you haven t already or the dragon s egg the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con cept some deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be necessary the unseen is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the reader listener but like all models a compro mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all crippled but what else can you do this is why i asked the above how would you then know god exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical i mean it s okay to say well satan is just metaphorical but then you have to justify this belief and justify that god is not some metaphor for something else i say this because there are many many instances of satan described as a being such as the tormentor in the old testament book of job or the temptor in the new testament gospels in the same way god too is described as a being or spirit how am i to know one is metaphorical and not the other further belief in god isn t a bar to evil let s consider the case of satanists even if satan were metaphorical the satanist would have to believe in god to justify this belief again we have a case where someone does believe in god but by religious standards they are evil if bobby does see this let him address this question also deleted some more on metaphor stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz ,0
 references deleted to move this to a new thread to put it as simply as possible i am not a muslim i do not accept the charge of apostacy because i have never in my adult life affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be said to have apostasized from the islam i know states clearly that there can be no coercion in matters of religion the many muslims i respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their faith purely by virtue of birth and that a person who freely chose not to be a muslim could therefore be put to death salman rushdie in good faith god satan paradise and hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth year when i quite abruptly lost my faith and afterwards to prove my new found atheism i bought myself a rather tasteless ham sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of the swine no thunderbolt arrived to strike me down from that day to this i have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person salman rushdie in god we trust only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the nature of the novel could think such a thing i ll accept it reluctantly from mobs in pakistan but not from you what is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual mohammad what s worse the novel doesn t present the mahound mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of islam in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives don t hold back he s considered an apostate and a blasphemer however it s not for his writing in the satanic verses but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book i have yet to find one single muslim who has convinced me that they have read the book some have initially claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial newsweek story might impart and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book i ll keep an eye out for it i have a counter proposal i suggest that you see the viking hardcover by salman rushdie called the satanic verses perhaps then you ll understand ,0
 deletions if this is grounded firmly in islam as you claim then you have just exposed islam as the grounds for terrorism plain and simple whether you like it or not whether rushdie acted like a total jerk or not there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words it simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult muslims and their beliefs got that you do not threaten the life of someone for words when you do you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position if you support threatening the life of someone for words you are not yet civilized this is exactly where i and many of the people i know have to depart from respecting the religions of others when those beliefs allow and encourage by interpretation the killing of non physical opposition you or i or anyone are more than privledged to believe that someone whether it be rushdie or bush or hussien or whover is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his her soul refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him her peacably demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the miscreants or whatever short of physical force but once you physically threaten or support physical threats you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape with you as the rapist who whines she asked for it look how she was dressed blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn t fly dew,0

 i answer from the position that we would indeed place these people in prison for life that depends not only on their predisposition towards murder but also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability to commit the same crimes again in other words if lifetime imprisonment doesn t work perhaps it s not because we re not executing these people but because we re not being careful enough about how we lock them up bob beauchaine bobbe vice ico tek com they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea ,0
 and that of course is the point you can t simply divide the world into atheists and non atheists on the basis of god belief if all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion but once you start talking about behaviour then someone s suscept ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are i assume worried about and in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and easily led on the other i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point ,0
 that s okay it s what all the rest of them who come on here say this isn t the guy who was a lawyer was he could you give more info on this guy never mind i m sure there will be plenty of responses to this post and it will appear there this is true make sure it is true for all cases why not both why not die for a lie if you were poverty stricken and alunatic sounds perfecetly reasoable to me as to whether the societal dregs he had for followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not not necessarily even if he died for what he believed in this still makes him completely selfish like us all so what s the difference people there is no historical proof of this see earlier threads besides he or at least his name have been the cause of enough deaths to make up for whatever healing he gave sieg heil who is david koresh i am curious therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the how does this follow your definition of lunatic and disproof thereof seem rather uhhh shaky good idea naturally those or not true christians right someone else handle this i don t know if it s worth it sigh ,0

 see there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary why do you think this and anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts you are attaching too many things to the term moral i think let s try this is it good that animals of the same species don t kill each other or do you think this is right or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong those weren t arbitrary killings they were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot yes it was but i still don t understand your distinctions what do you mean by consider can a small child be moral how about a gorilla a dolphin a platypus where is the line drawn does the being need to be self aware what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from arbitrarily killing each other don t you find the fact that they don t at all significant ,0

this kind of argument cries for a comment god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldn t we perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required precise targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self splicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this try watson s molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore s molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesn t mean it s perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we ve thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i d replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite like layers date back to billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve i m sorry i can t give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration i can understand scott s reaction excuse me but this is so far fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know that i hope you don t forget this we have evidence that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to believe in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one s own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods didn t make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i haven t seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john s question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god s fault the original question i say no it is not of course nothing evil is god s fault but your explanation does not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you don t know that satan is not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i don t think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting diseases why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it s not perfect yet but i m working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they don t explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a why behind and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty details of biology and genetics although i m sure i d find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i m sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can come into existence

 of course b m is not incorrect he is defending islam when defending islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you but when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm so b m can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the temporary atheists can later say that they were always good muslims because they never explicitly rejected islam ,0

 if the first rule of humor is never having to say you re sorry then the second rule must be never having to explain yourself few things are worse that a joke explained in spite of this and because of requests for me to post my list o nicknames i must admit that no such list exists it was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper o the list to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to advance the idea that such a list should be made i assumed that the ol timers would recognize it for what it is nevertheless how about a list o nicknames for alt atheism posters if you think of a good one just post it and see if others like it we could start with those posters who annoy us the most like bobby or bill jim d oh i broke the second rule of humor copeland,0

 deleted think deleted let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact different than not believing in a god or gods i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i don t know and therefore don t believe in them and don t not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence i as a christian maintain that god does not exist to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have being god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal with this said i feel it s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god and that is not what i m doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in it s usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are using it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god we also might differ upon what it means to have faith here is what faith a allegiance to duty or a person loyalty b fidelity to one s promises sincerity of intentions a belief and trust in and loyalty to god belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b firm belief in something for which there is no proof complete trust something that is believed esp with strong conviction esp a system of religious beliefs syn see belief one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are you refering to there are no observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a positive belief all observations can only point you in a direction a direction that we might even be predisposed to by predisposed i mean for example people whoes partents believe in god also tend to to actually draw a conclusion about the existence or non existence of god requires a leap and you have made this leap when you actively say i believe that god does does not exist personally i think that both statements are misguided arguing over the existence of god is precisely the wrong way to find him and yes i use him because a personal god is the only viable concept imo if a person wants to use she go ahead of course god is neither he nor she but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise if you want me to explain myself further i ll be glad to and please if someone does not agree with me even if they violently disagree it s in no ones advantage to start name calling if a person thinks i ve misunderstood something in the faqs or if they they think i have not read them well enough just point out to me the error of my ways and i correct the situation i m interested in a polite and well thought out discussion ,0

 but now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way and i don t think you ve even noticed in another part of this thread you ve been telling us that the goal of a natural morality is what animals do to survive but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some other species either terrestrial or alien does that make it moral to do so ,0
 bobby there s a question here that i just have to ask if all of your posts aren t some sort of extended elaborate hoax why are you trying so hard to convince the entire civilised world that you re feeble minded you have a talent for saying the most absurd things here s a little sign for you print it cut it out and put it on top of your computer terminal engage brain prior to operating keyboard having said all that i must admit we all get a laugh from your stuff ,0

 no the christians were leary of having an atheist spokesman seems so clandestine and all that so they had him removed of course keith is busy explaining to his fellow captives how he isn t really being persecuted since after all they are feeding him and any resistance on his part would only be viewed as trouble making i understand he did make a bit of a fuss when they tatooed in god we trust on his forehead though bob beauchaine bobbe vice ico tek com they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea ,0
 i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon it is not comprehensive but it is well researched i imagine your library has it or can get it for you through interlibrary loan i shall try to get hold of it when i have time to read of course in short dr baucaille began investigating the bible because of pre ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies he assumed that some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by gone days so he read what he could find in hebrew greek aramaic what he found was that the problems didn t go away they got worse then he decided to see if other religions had the same problems so he picked up the holy qur an in french and found similar prob lems but not as many so he applied the same logoic as he had with the bible he learned to read it in arabic the problems he had found with the french version went away in arabic he was unable to find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy qur an but what he did find made sense with modern understanding so he investigated the traditions the hadith to see what they had to say about science they were filled with science problems after all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by pour standards a primitive world view his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy qur an had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy qur an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy qur an assuming he had authored it so in short the writer or writers of quran decided to stay away from science if you do not open your mouth then you don t put you foot into your mouth either but then if you say quran does not talk much about science then one can not make claims like bobby does that you have great science in quran basically i want to say that none of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises so i am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims vinayak vinayak dutt e mail vdp mayo edu standard disclaimers apply,0

responds to a lot of grief given to him a k a the sagemaster most of scotty s followup was irrelevant to the original question but this is not unusual as threads often quickly evolve away from the original topic what i could not understand is why jim spent so much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies well i guess hypothetical adam was the majority of mankind seeing how he was the only man at the time i understand what you mean by collective but i think it is an insane perversion of justice what sort of judge would punish the descendants for a crime committed by their ancestor well i must admit that you probably read a a more often than i read the bible these days but you missed a couple of good followups to your post i m sending you a personal copy of my followup which i hope you will respond to publically in a a ,0
 no need to correct it it stands as it is said you miss the point entirely things defined by contradictory language do not exist though something existing might be meant conclusions drawn from the description are wrong unless there is the possibility to find the described and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described then another possibility is to drop the contradictory part but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well neither am i but either things are directly sensed which includes some form of modelling by the way or they are used in modelling using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of wonder why ,0
 tammy is this all explicitly stated in the bible or do you assume that you know that ezekiel indirectly mentioned it could have been another metaphor for instance ezekiel was mad at his landlord so he talked about him when he wrote about the prince of tyre sorry but my interpretation is more mundane ezekiel wrote about the prince of tyre when we wrote about the prince of tyre cheers kent,0
 i have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again khomeini put a price on the head of someone in another country this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve islamic leaders the twelve imams who are free of error or sin this makes him a heretic in the qur an muhammad is chastised for error directly by god the qur an says that muhammad is the greatest example of proper islamic behavior thus no muslim is free from error perhaps it seems so to you but this is hardly the case there is widespread agreement about matters of islam there certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly islamic in and of themselves but this is so for any large group of people under the same name the qur an is not particularly imprecise in wording though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words however as an entire text the qur an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them ,0
 i tend to agree i came here when it first started and watched it grow from the roots on talk religion misc it seemed to take a while for enough atheists to come forward to get past the let s trash xians and such now there s a stable core and frankly there s a feeling that this is our group if we go mainstream we re going to be in a lot more places and every fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find jeesus and warn us that we re all going to hell want to see what we ll get go real alt fan brother jed and imagine that those imbecilic tirades will be here all the time every other post i m being selfish i find i really learn a lot here and the s n isn t too bad the browns and the boobys are a distraction but they are few enough that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them but i greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping level of the conners of the world regards dew,0
 wow you re quicker to point out heresy than the church in the middle ages seriously though even the sheiks at al azhar don t claim that the shi ites are heretics most of the accusations and fabrications about shi ites come out of saudi arabia from the wahabis for that matter you should read the original works of the sunni imams imams of the four madhabs the teacher of at least two of them was imam jafar sadiq the sixth imam of the shi ites ,0

 the bible says there is a god if that is true then our atheism is mistaken what of it seems pretty obvious to me socrates said there were many gods if that is true then your monotheism and our atheism is mistaken even if socrates never existed jim i think you must have come in late the discussion on my part at least began with benedikt s questioning of the historical acuuracy of the nt i was making the point that if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit nt history then virtually nothing is known of the first century you seem to be saying that the bible cannot be true because it speaks of the existence of god as it it were a fact your objection has nothing to do with history it is merely another statement of atheism ,0
 but you haven t taken into the account of propoganda remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy well they haven t managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion they could create similar problems for us and it could be worse they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc but imagine what they d have to do to stop atheism so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation yes i d be glad if it were gone to i ve never supported it however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i don t think that most do do you think that all christians actively despise other religions most that i have met haven t and don t do so well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i can t say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths well i d really like to and i ve tried but i really don t know where to get access to congressional records from the s can anyone help out here only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money this is just not correct that is to say the religion of this country and the non religion of the ussr that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well i don t think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over non religion a specific religion was not mentioned so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong that s silly i think the flat earthers are wrong but i don t advocate their banishment i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency well mottos in general don t really have purposes i don t think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress why not it is the majority that put it there but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists why don t you include this in your little survey that you were conducting what should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy i mean if einstein said it there s a good chance that it was right at least at the time you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented yes some mushrooms can be planted and i don t appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either who was forced to put the motto there what do you mean ,0
archive name atheism faq alt atheism archive name faq last modified april version alt atheism frequently asked questions this file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in alt atheism points covered here are ones which are not covered in the introduction to atheism you are advised to read that article as well before posting these answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive the purpose of the periodic faq postings is not to stifle debate but to raise its level if you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn t covered by the answer given please feel free to make your point overview of contents what is the purpose of this newsgroup hitler was an atheist the bible proves it pascal s wager what is occam s razor why it s good to believe in jesus why i know that god exists einstein and god does not play dice everyone worships something why there must be a causeless cause the universe is so complex it must have been designed independent evidence that the bible is true godel s incompleteness theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell is biblical contradictions wanted the usa is a christian nation the usa is not a christian nation subject what is the purpose of this newsgroup typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism why do atheists organize in groups what is there to discuss response many things are discussed here including whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one s family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet how religious societies prey sic on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists of course inevitably alt atheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert most readers of the newsgroup don t want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed postings subject hitler was an atheist typical posting hitler was an atheist and look at what he did response adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist as he said himself the folkish minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making people stop just talking superficially of god s will and actually fulfill god s will and not let god s word be desecrated orig ital for god s will gave men their form their essence and their abilities anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the lord s creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord orig ital adolf hitler from mein kampf trans ralph mannheim of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong it s also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god we certainly can t conclude that he s an atheist though subject the bible proves it typical posting in the bible it says that response most of the readers of alt atheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy this isn t to say that the bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate note that this feeling tends to extend to other books it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion subject pascal s wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you don t believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist response this argument is known as pascal s wager it has several flaws firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion y s version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true suppose you re believing in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition it is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis formally speaking the argument consists of four statements one does not know whether god exists not believing in god is bad for one s eternal soul if god does exist believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist therefore it is in one s interest to believe in god there are two approaches to the argument the first is to view as an assumption and as a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information this is considered invalid in information theory statement indicates one has no information about god but statement indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god this violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information at no cost the alternative approach is to claim that and are both assumptions the problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which states the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests to believe in god a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed the biggest reason why pascal s wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him subject what is occam s razor typical posting people keep talking about occam s razor what is it response william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam s razor in its original form it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to occam s razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simplest solution the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who created the universe clearly this god must be of non zero complexity given that both explanations fit the facts occam s razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution there isn t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there is this third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why it s good to believe in jesus typical posting i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion response preaching is not appreciated feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme such postings do not belong on alt atheism and will be rejected from alt atheism moderated try the newsgroup talk religion misc you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before subject why i know that god exists typical posting i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists response just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist that evidence varies from person to person furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by ufos visited by the ghost of elvis and so on subject einstein and god does not play dice typical posting albert einstein believed in god do you think you re cleverer than him response einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god used this way it is out of context it refers to einstein s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermore einstein s religious background was jewish rather than christian a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believed that qm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations so far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be a longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a symposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york in the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is false subject everyone worships something typical posting everyone worships something whether it s money power or god response if that is true everyone is a polytheist theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god surely you don t think all this appeared here just by chance response this is known as the argument from design it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk origins for a while there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can t have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator indeed stephen hawking in his book a brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the so called watchmaker argument one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally of course one assumes a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all arguments by design firstly a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn t assume it was created by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the bible is true typical posting the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence for example response the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence early versions of josephus s work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james the extant version discusses john in a non christian context many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing but that this was expanded by christian copyists several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about c e it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesus is more well documented for further information please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup soc religion christian subject godel s incompleteness theorem typical posting godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete response godel s first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with it may then be possible to show that godel s incompleteness theorem holds for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system furthermore it certainly wouldn t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions another frequent claim is that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense subject george bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens response the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist press and george bush on august sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois the discussion turned to the presidential primary rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists gb i guess i m pretty weak in the atheist community faith in god is important to me rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists gb no i don t know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church gb yes i support the separation of church and state i m just not very high on atheists upi reported on may that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february it can also be found in free enquiry magazine fall issue volume number page on october mr sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane cochairman of the bush quayle illinois campaign this concerned a lawsuit mr sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district chicago illinois from forcing his first grade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bush s phrase the following conversation took place rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing em it s bullshit rs what is bullshit em everything that american atheists does rob is bullshit rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue em you re welcome after bush s election american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement on february st c boyden gray counsel to the president replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government for further information contact american atheist veterans at the american atheist press s cameron road address subject i know where hell is typical posting i know where hell is hell is in norway response there are several towns called hell in various countries around the world including norway and the usa whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of alt atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week subject biblical contradictions wanted typical posting does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions response american atheist press publish an atheist s handbook detailing biblical contradictions see the accompanying posting on atheist resources for details there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the archive server mantis co uk see the contacts file for more information subject the usa is a christian nation typical posting because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn t the united states be considered a christian nation response based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation here are some quotes there are many more what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not james madison a memorial and remonstrance i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the cross consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced john adams in a letter to thomas jefferson history i believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt i cannot conceive otherwise than that he the infinite father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that he is even infinitely above it benjamin franklin from articles of belief and acts of religion nov subject the usa is not a christian nation typical posting is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion response no the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the treaty of tripoli stat treaty series article as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america vol pp the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u s senate on june and ratified by president john adams on june it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks article xi altogether the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow consul general at algiers a close friend of thomas paine and an opponent of christianity it is possible that barlow made up article xi but since there is no arabic version of that article to be found it s hard to say in a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation ,0
trh i hope you re not going to flame him please give him the same coutesy you trh ve given me but you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return this person instead has posted one of the worst arguments i have ever seen made from the pro christian people i ve known several jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them let s ignore the fact that it s not a true trilemma for the moment nice word maddi original or is it a real word and concentrate on the liar lunatic part the argument claims that no one would follow a liar let alone thousands of people look at l ron hubbard now he was probably not all there but i think he was mostly a liar and a con artist but look at how many thousands of people follow dianetics and scientology i think the baker s and swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time but look at the number of follower they have as for lunatics the best example is hitler he was obviously insane his advisors certainly thought so yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of europe how many germans gave their lives for him to this day he has his followers i m just amazed that people still try to use this argument it s just so obviously wrong ,0

 the above is probably not the most representative paragraph but i thought i d hop on anyway what strikes me as self contradicting in the fable of lucifer s fall which by the way i seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text but my ex rcism may be showing is that as benedikt pointed out lucifer had perfect nature yet he had the free will to choose evil but where did that choice come from we know from genesis that eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was satan but how did lucifer discover invent create call the action what you will something that god had not given origin to also where in the bible is there mention of lucifer s free will we make a big fuss about mankind having free will but it strikes me as being an after the fact rationalisation and in fact like salvation not one that all christians believe in identically at least in my mind salvation and free will are very tightly coupled but then my theology was roman catholic still how do theologian explain lucifer s fall if lucifer had perfect nature did man how could he fall how could he execute an act that a contradicted his nature and b in effect cause evil to exist for the first time ,0

 sorry wrong this is how banks got started in the first place sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke and then they will realise that they havn t been managing risk very well then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry and since they don t all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money some of them will specialise in that then they ll reinvent interest but like good muslims they ll call it something else riiiight that s why john major opened a new government department a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business because they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar ,0

 first post i ve seen from the ol bug zoo bgsu there is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt that a god does not exist but if anyone has one by all means tell me what it is therefore lacking this ability of absolute proof being an atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself and this i cannot accept i accept nothing on blind faith invisible pink flying unicorns need i say more there is also the question of what is meant by atheist a familiar example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows the two statements following are consistent i do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks i do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks the two statements following are not consistent i do believe that you are wearing lilac socks i do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks statements and require no faith they make no presumptions about the nature of reality statements and require belief many atheists myself included take the following position i do not believe that there is a god i do not believe that there is not a god ,0
